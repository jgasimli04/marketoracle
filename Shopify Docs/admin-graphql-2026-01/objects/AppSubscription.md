## Mutations

* [app​Subscription​Cancel](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionCancel)

  mutation

  Cancels an active app subscription, stopping future billing cycles. The cancellation behavior depends on the `replacementBehavior` setting - it can either disable auto-renewal (allowing the subscription to continue until the end of the current billing period) or immediately cancel with prorated refunds.

  When a merchant decides to discontinue using subscription features, this mutation provides a clean cancellation workflow that respects billing periods and merchant expectations.

  Use the `AppSubscriptionCancel` mutation to:

  * Process merchant-initiated subscription cancellations
  * Terminate subscriptions due to policy violations or account issues
  * Handle subscription cancellations during app uninstallation workflows

  The cancellation timing and merchant access depends on the `replacementBehavior` setting and the app's specific implementation of subscription management.

  For subscription lifecycle management and cancellation best practices, consult the [subscription management guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/subscription-billing).

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the app subscription to be cancelled.

  * prorate

    [Boolean](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/Boolean)

    Default:false

    Whether to issue prorated credits for the unused portion of the app subscription. There will be a corresponding deduction (based on revenue share) to your Partner account. For example, if a $10.00 app subscription (with 0% revenue share) is cancelled and prorated half way through the billing cycle, then the merchant will be credited $5.00 and that amount will be deducted from your Partner account.

  ***

* [app​Subscription​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a recurring or usage-based [`AppSubscription`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscription) that charges merchants for app features and services. The subscription includes one or more [`AppSubscriptionLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscriptionLineItem) objects that define the pricing structure, billing intervals, and optional [`AppSubscriptionDiscount`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscriptionDiscount) values.

  Returns a [confirmation URL](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionCreate#returns-confirmationUrl) where the merchant approves or declines the charges. After approval, the subscription becomes active and billing begins after any trial period expires. You can specify [`AppSubscriptionReplacementBehavior`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/AppSubscriptionReplacementBehavior) to control how this subscription interacts with existing active subscriptions.

* [app​Subscription​Line​Item​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionLineItemUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates the capped amount on usage-based billing for an [`AppSubscriptionLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscriptionLineItem). Enables you to modify the maximum charge limit that prevents merchants from exceeding a specified threshold during their billing period.

  The mutation returns a [confirmation URL](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionCreate#returns-confirmationUrl) where the merchant must approve the new pricing limit before it takes effect. Use this when adjusting usage limits based on merchant needs or changing pricing models.

  ***

* [app​Subscription​Trial​Extend](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appSubscriptionTrialExtend)

  mutation

  Extends the trial period for an existing app subscription. Trial extensions give merchants additional time to use the app before committing to paid billing.

  Requires the subscription ID and the number of days to extend (between one and 1000). The extension modifies the existing trial end date, allowing continued access to subscription features without immediate billing. Returns the updated [`AppSubscription`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppSubscription).
