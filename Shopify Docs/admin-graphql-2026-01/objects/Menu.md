title: Menu - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Navigation menus that organize links into logical structures to guide
  customers through a store. Menus serve as the backbone of store navigation,
  making it easy for customers to find products, pages, and other content
  through organized hierarchical links.


  For example, a merchant might create a main navigation menu with top-level
  categories like "Products," "About Us," and "Contact," where each category can
  contain nested menu items linking to specific collections, pages, or external
  resources.


  Use the `Menu` object to:

  - Build and customize store navigation structures

  - Organize hierarchical menu systems with nested items

  - Work with default menus that can't be deleted

  - Access menu items for building navigation


  Menus can be designated as default navigation elements (like main menu or
  footer), which can't be deleted and have restricted handle updates. The handle
  provides a unique identifier that themes can reference, while the items
  collection enables nested navigation structures.


  Each menu contains menu items that can link to various resource types. This
  flexibility lets merchants create navigation experiences that guide customers
  through their store.

# Menu

object

Requires `read_online_store_navigation` access scope.

Navigation menus that organize links into logical structures to guide customers through a store. Menus serve as the backbone of store navigation, making it easy for customers to find products, pages, and other content through organized hierarchical links.

For example, a merchant might create a main navigation menu with top-level categories like "Products," "About Us," and "Contact," where each category can contain nested menu items linking to specific collections, pages, or external resources.

Use the `Menu` object to:

* Build and customize store navigation structures
* Organize hierarchical menu systems with nested items
* Work with default menus that can't be deleted
* Access menu items for building navigation

Menus can be designated as default navigation elements (like main menu or footer), which can't be deleted and have restricted handle updates. The handle provides a unique identifier that themes can reference, while the items collection enables nested navigation structures.

Each menu contains menu items that can link to various resource types. This flexibility lets merchants create navigation experiences that guide customers through their store.
