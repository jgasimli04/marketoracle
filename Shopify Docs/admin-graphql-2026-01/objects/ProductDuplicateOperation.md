## Mutations

* [product​Duplicate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productDuplicate)

  mutation

  Duplicates a product.

  If you need to duplicate a large product, such as one that has many [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductVariantInput) that are active at several [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/InventoryLevelInput), you might encounter timeout errors.

  To avoid these timeout errors, you can instead duplicate the product asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-10 and higher, include `synchronous: false` argument in this mutation to perform the duplication asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-07 and lower, use the asynchronous [`ProductDuplicateAsyncV2`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/mutations/productDuplicateAsyncV2).

  Metafield values are not duplicated if the unique values capability is enabled.

  * product​Id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the product to be duplicated.

  * new​Title

    [String!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/String)

    required

    The new title of the product.

  * new​Status

    [Product​Status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/ProductStatus)

    The new status of the product. If no value is provided the status will be inherited from the original product.

  * include​Images

    [Boolean](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/Boolean)

    Default:false

    Specifies whether or not to duplicate images.

  * include​Translations

    [Boolean](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/Boolean)

    Default:false

    Specifies whether or not to duplicate translations.

  * synchronous

    [Boolean](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/Boolean)

    Default:true

    Specifies whether or not to run the mutation synchronously.
