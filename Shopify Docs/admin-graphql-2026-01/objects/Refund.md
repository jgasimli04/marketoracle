title: Refund - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  The `Refund` object represents a financial record of money returned to a
  customer from an order.

  It provides a comprehensive view of all refunded amounts, transactions, and
  restocking instructions

  associated with returning products or correcting order issues.


  The `Refund` object provides information to:


  - Process customer returns and issue payments back to customers

  - Handle partial or full refunds for line items with optional inventory
  restocking

  - Refund shipping costs, duties, and additional fees

  - Issue store credit refunds as an alternative to original payment method
  returns

  - Track and reconcile all financial transactions related to refunds


  Each `Refund` object maintains detailed records of what was refunded, how much
  was refunded,

  which payment transactions were involved, and any inventory restocking that
  occurred. The refund

  can include multiple components such as product line items, shipping charges,
  taxes, duties, and

  additional fees, all calculated with proper currency handling for
  international orders.


  Refunds are always associated with an
  [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  and can optionally be linked to a
  [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return)

  if the refund was initiated through the returns process. The refund tracks
  both the presentment currency

  (what the customer sees) and the shop currency for accurate financial
  reporting.


  > Note:

  > The existence of a `Refund` object doesn't guarantee that the money has been
  returned to the customer.

  > The actual financial processing happens through associated

  >
  [`OrderTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction)

# Refund

object

Requires `read_orders` access scope or `read_marketplace_orders` access scope.

The `Refund` object represents a financial record of money returned to a customer from an order. It provides a comprehensive view of all refunded amounts, transactions, and restocking instructions associated with returning products or correcting order issues.

The `Refund` object provides information to:

* Process customer returns and issue payments back to customers
* Handle partial or full refunds for line items with optional inventory restocking
* Refund shipping costs, duties, and additional fees
* Issue store credit refunds as an alternative to original payment method returns
* Track and reconcile all financial transactions related to refunds

Each `Refund` object maintains detailed records of what was refunded, how much was refunded, which payment transactions were involved, and any inventory restocking that occurred. The refund can include multiple components such as product line items, shipping charges, taxes, duties, and additional fees, all calculated with proper currency handling for international orders.

Refunds are always associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and can optionally be linked to a [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return) if the refund was initiated through the returns process. The refund tracks both the presentment currency (what the customer sees) and the shop currency for accurate financial reporting.

Note

The existence of a `Refund` object doesn't guarantee that the money has been returned to the customer. The actual financial processing happens through associated [`OrderTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction) objects, which can be in various states, such as pending, processing, success, or failure. To determine if money has actually been refunded, check the [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction#field-OrderTransaction.fields.status) of the associated transactions.

## Mutations

* [refund​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/refundCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a refund for an order, allowing you to process returns and issue payments back to customers.

  Use the `refundCreate` mutation to programmatically process refunds in scenarios where you need to return money to customers, such as when handling returns, processing chargebacks, or correcting order errors.

  The `refundCreate` mutation supports various refund scenarios:

  * Refunding line items with optional restocking
  * Refunding shipping costs
  * Refunding duties and import taxes
  * Refunding additional fees
  * Processing refunds through different payment methods
  * Issuing store credit refunds (when enabled)

  You can create both full and partial refunds, and optionally allow over-refunding in specific cases.

  After creating a refund, you can track its status and details through the order's [`refunds`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.refunds) field. The refund is associated with the order and can be used for reporting and reconciliation purposes.

  ***

  Note

  The refunding behavior of the `refundCreate` mutation is similar to the [`refundReturn`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnRefund) mutation. The key difference is that the `refundCreate` mutation lets you to specify restocking behavior for line items, whereas the `returnRefund` mutation focuses solely on handling the financial refund without any restocking input.
