## Queries

* [product​Resource​Feedback](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productResourceFeedback)

  query

  Retrieves product resource feedback for the currently authenticated app, providing insights into product data quality, completeness, and optimization opportunities. This feedback helps apps guide merchants toward better product listings and improved store performance.

  For example, an SEO app might receive feedback indicating that certain products lack meta descriptions or have suboptimal titles, enabling the app to provide specific recommendations for improving search visibility and conversion rates.

  Use `ProductResourceFeedback` to:

  * Display product optimization recommendations to merchants
  * Identify data quality issues across product catalogs
  * Build product improvement workflows and guided experiences
  * Track progress on product listing completeness and quality
  * Implement automated product auditing and scoring systems
  * Generate reports on catalog health and optimization opportunities
  * Provide contextual suggestions within product editing interfaces

  The feedback system evaluates products against various criteria including SEO best practices, required fields, media quality, and sales channel requirements. Each feedback item includes specific details about the issue, suggested improvements, and priority levels.

  Feedback is app-specific and reflects the particular focus of your application - marketing apps receive different insights than inventory management apps. The system continuously updates as merchants make changes, providing real-time guidance for product optimization.

  This resource is particularly valuable for apps that help merchants improve their product listings, optimize for search engines, or enhance their overall catalog quality. The feedback enables proactive suggestions rather than reactive problem-solving.
