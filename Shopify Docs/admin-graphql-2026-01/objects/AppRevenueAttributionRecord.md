title: AppRevenueAttributionRecord - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Tracks revenue that was captured outside of Shopify's billing system but needs
  to be attributed to the app for comprehensive revenue reporting and partner
  analytics. This object enables accurate revenue tracking when apps process
  payments through external systems while maintaining visibility into total app
  performance.


  External revenue attribution is essential for apps that offer multiple payment
  channels or process certain transactions outside Shopify's billing
  infrastructure. For example, an enterprise app might process large custom
  contracts through external payment processors, or a marketplace app could
  handle direct merchant-to-merchant transactions that still generate app
  commissions.


  Use the `AppRevenueAttributionRecord` object to:

  - Report revenue from external payment processors and billing systems

  - Track commission-based earnings from marketplace or referral activities

  - Maintain comprehensive revenue analytics across multiple payment channels

  - Ensure accurate partner revenue sharing and commission calculations

  - Generate complete financial reports that include all app-generated revenue
  streams

  - Support compliance requirements for external revenue documentation


  Each attribution record includes the captured amount, external transaction
  timestamp, and idempotency keys to prevent duplicate reporting. The record
  type field categorizes different revenue streams, enabling detailed analytics
  and reporting segmentation.


  Revenue attribution records are particularly important for apps participating
  in Shopify's partner program, as they ensure accurate revenue sharing
  calculations and comprehensive performance metrics. The captured timestamp
  reflects when the external payment was processed, not when the attribution
  record was created in Shopify.


  For detailed revenue attribution values, see the [AppRevenueAttributionType
  enum](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/AppRevenueAttributionType).
