## Mutations

* [product​Bundle​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productBundleCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a product bundle that groups multiple [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) objects together as components. The bundle appears as a single product in the store, with its price determined by the parent product and inventory calculated from the component products.

  The mutation runs asynchronously and returns a [`ProductBundleOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductBundleOperation) object to track the creation status. Poll the operation using the [`productOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productOperation) query to determine when the bundle is ready.
