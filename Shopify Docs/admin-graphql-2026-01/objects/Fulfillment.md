## Queries

* [fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillment)

  query

  Retrieves a [`Fulfillment`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) by its ID. A fulfillment is a record that the merchant has completed their work required for one or more line items in an [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). It includes tracking information, [`LineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem) objects, and the status of the fulfillment.

  Use this query to track the progress of shipped items, view tracking details, or check [fulfillment events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentEvent) for example when a package is out for delivery or delivered.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

## Mutations

* [fulfillment​Cancel](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentCancel)

  mutation

  Cancels an existing [`Fulfillment`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and reverses its effects on associated [`FulfillmentOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) objects. When you cancel a fulfillment, the system creates new fulfillment orders for the cancelled items so they can be fulfilled again.

  The cancellation affects fulfillment orders differently based on their fulfillment status. If a fulfillment order was entirely fulfilled, then it automatically closes. If a fulfillment order is partially fulfilled, then the remaining quantities adjust to include the cancelled items. The system creates new fulfillment orders at the original [`Location`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location) when items are still stocked there, or at alternative locations based on the store's fulfillment priority settings.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment to be canceled.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a fulfillment for one or more [`FulfillmentOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) objects. The fulfillment orders are associated with the same [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and are assigned to the same [`Location`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location).

  Use this mutation to mark items as fulfilled when they're ready to ship. You can specify tracking information, customer notification preferences, and which [`FulfillmentOrderLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/fulfillmentorderlineitem) objects to fulfill from each fulfillment order. If you don't specify line items, then the mutation fulfills all items in the fulfillment order.

  * fulfillment

* [fulfillment​Tracking​Info​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates tracking information for a fulfillment, including the carrier name, tracking numbers, and tracking URLs. You can provide either single or multiple tracking numbers for shipments with multiple packages.

  The mutation accepts a [`FulfillmentTrackingInput`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/FulfillmentTrackingInput) that supports both single tracking (using [`number`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate#arguments-trackingInfoInput.fields.number) and [`url`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate#arguments-trackingInfoInput.fields.url) fields) and multi-package tracking (using [`numbers`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate#arguments-trackingInfoInput.fields.numbers) and [`urls`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate#arguments-trackingInfoInput.fields.urls) fields). When you specify a [supported carrier name](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentTrackingInfo#supported-tracking-companies), Shopify automatically generates tracking URLs for the provided tracking numbers.

  You can optionally notify customers about tracking updates with the [`notifyCustomer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate#arguments-notifyCustomer) argument. When enabled, customers receive shipping update emails with tracking details and receive notifications about future updates to the fulfillment.
