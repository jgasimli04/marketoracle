title: WebhookPubSubEndpoint - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Individual Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics that receive webhook events for
  reliable, asynchronous processing. This endpoint type lets your app tap into
  Google Cloud's messaging infrastructure to handle events at scale.


  For example, when inventory levels change, Shopify can publish these events to
  your Pub/Sub topic `projects/your-project/topics/inventory-updates`, allowing
  your Google Cloud functions or services to process inventory changes at their
  own pace.


  Pub/Sub endpoints provide reliable message delivery to Google Cloud Pub/Sub,
  making them excellent for apps that need to handle variable webhook volumes or
  integrate with Google Cloud Platform services.
