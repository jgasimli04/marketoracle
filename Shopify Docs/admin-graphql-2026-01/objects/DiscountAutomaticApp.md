This information includes the app extension's name and [client ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/client-secrets), [App Bridge configuration](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/app-bridge), [discount class](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/combining-discounts/discount-combinations), [function ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/functions/input-output/metafields-for-input-queries), and other metadata about the discount type, including the discount type's name and description.

  For example, use this mutation to create an automatic discount using an app's "Volume" discount type that applies a percentage off when customers purchase more than the minimum quantity of a product. For an example implementation, refer to [our tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts/build-discount-function).
