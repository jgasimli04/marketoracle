title: InventoryQuantity - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  The `InventoryQuantity` object lets you manage and track inventory quantities
  for specific
  [states](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/fulfillment/inventory-management-apps#inventory-states).

  Inventory quantities represent different states of items such as available for
  purchase, committed to orders, reserved for drafts, incoming from suppliers,
  or set aside for quality control or safety stock.


  You can use [inventory
  levels](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/inventorylevel)
  to manage where inventory items are stocked. You can also [make inventory
  adjustments](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/inventoryAdjustQuantities)
  to apply changes to inventory quantities.


  Inventory quantities can be managed by a merchant or by [fulfillment
  services](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/fulfillmentservice)
  that handle inventory tracking.

  system](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/fulfillment/inventory-management-apps).
