      - Filter resources by their visibility and publication state on a channel. Online store channel filtering: - `online_store_channel`: Returns all resources in the online store channel, regardless of publication status. - `published`/`visible`: Returns resources that are published to the online store. - `unpublished`: Returns resources that are not published to the online store. Channel-specific filtering using the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`) with suffixes: - `{channel_app_id}-published`: Returns resources published to the specified channel. - `{channel_app_id}-visible`: Same as `{channel_app_id}-published` (kept for backwards compatibility). - `{channel_app_id}-intended`: Returns resources added to the channel but not yet published. - `{channel_app_id}-hidden`: Returns resources not added to the channel or not published. Other: - `unavailable`: Returns resources not published to any channel.

      - Valid values:
        * `online_store_channel`

## Mutations

* [collection​Delete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/collectionDelete)

  mutation

  Deletes a collection and removes it permanently from the store. This operation cannot be undone and will remove the collection from all sales channels where it was published.

  For example, when merchants discontinue seasonal promotions or reorganize their catalog structure, they can delete outdated collections like "Back to School 2023" to keep their store organized.

  Use `CollectionDelete` to:

  * Remove outdated or unused collections from stores
  * Clean up collection structures during catalog reorganization
  * Implement collection management tools with deletion capabilities

  Products within the deleted collection remain in the store but are no longer grouped under that collection.

  Learn more about [collection management](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection).

  * input

    [Collection​Delete​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/CollectionDeleteInput)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The collection to delete.

  ***

* [customer​Delete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/customerDelete)

  mutation

  Deletes a [`Customer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer) from the store. You can only delete customers who haven't placed any [orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order).

  Apps using protected customer data must meet Shopify's [protected customer data requirements](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/protected-customer-data#requirements).

  * input

    [Customer​Delete​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/CustomerDeleteInput)

    ### Arguments

    Specifies the customer to delete.

  ***

* [delegate​Access​Token​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/delegateAccessTokenCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [`DelegateAccessToken`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DelegateAccessToken) with a subset of the parent token's permissions.

  Delegate access tokens enable secure permission delegation to subsystems or services that need limited access to shop resources. Each token inherits only the scopes you specify, ensuring subsystems operate with minimal required permissions rather than full app access.

  Learn more about [delegating access tokens to subsystems](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/use-delegate-tokens).

  * input

    [Delegate​Access​Token​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/DelegateAccessTokenInput)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The input fields for creating a delegate access token.

  ***

* [delegate​Access​Token​Destroy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/delegateAccessTokenDestroy)

  mutation

  Destroys a delegate access token.

  * access​Token

    [String!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/String)

    required

    ### Arguments

    Provides the delegate access token to destroy.

  ***

* [product​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) with attributes such as title, description, vendor, and media.

  The `productCreate` mutation helps you create many products at once, avoiding the tedious or time-consuming process of adding them one by one in the Shopify admin. Common examples include creating products for a new collection, launching a new product line, or adding seasonal products.

  You can define product [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and [values](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue), allowing you to create products with different variations like sizes or colors. You can also associate media files to your products, including images and videos.

  The `productCreate` mutation only supports creating a product with its initial [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant). To create multiple product variants for a single product and manage prices, use the [`productVariantsBulkCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkCreate) mutation.

  ***

  Note

  The `productCreate` mutation has a [throttle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits#resource-based-rate-limits) that takes effect when a store has 50,000 product variants. After this threshold is reached, no more than 1,000 new product variants can be created per day.

  ***

  After you create a product, you can make subsequent edits to the product using one of the following mutations:

  * [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish): Used to publish the product and make it available to customers. The `productCreate` mutation creates products in an unpublished state by default, so you must perform a separate operation to publish the product.
  * [`productUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate): Used to update a single product, such as changing the product's title, description, vendor, or associated media.
  * [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet): Used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.

  Learn more about the [product model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate/new-product-model) and [adding product data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate/new-product-model/add-data).

  * input

    [Product​Input](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductInput)

    Deprecated

    ### Arguments

  * product

    [Product​Create​Input](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductCreateInput)

    The attributes of the new product.

  * media

    [\[Create​Media​Input!\]](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/CreateMediaInput)

    The media to add to the product.

  ***

* [product​Delete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productDelete)

  mutation

  Permanently deletes a product and all its associated data, including variants, media, publications, and inventory items.

  Use the `productDelete` mutation to programmatically remove products from your store when they need to be permanently deleted from your catalog, such as when removing discontinued items, cleaning up test data, or synchronizing with external inventory management systems.

  The `productDelete` mutation removes the product from all associated collections, and removes all associated data for the product, including:

  * All product variants and their inventory items
  * Product media (images, videos) that are not referenced by other products
  * [Product options](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and [option values](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue)
  * Product publications across all sales channels
  * Product tags and metadata associations

  The `productDelete` mutation also has the following effects on existing orders and transactions:

  * **Draft orders**: Existing draft orders that reference this product will retain the product information as stored data, but the product reference will be removed. Draft orders can still be completed with the stored product details.
  * **Completed orders and refunds**: Previously completed orders that included this product aren't affected. The product information in completed orders is preserved for record-keeping, and existing refunds for this product remain valid and processable.

  ***

  Caution

  Product deletion is irreversible. After a product is deleted, it can't be recovered. Consider archiving or unpublishing products instead if you might need to restore them later.

  ***

  If you need to delete a large product, such as one that has many [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) that are active at several [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location), you might encounter timeout errors. To avoid these timeout errors, you can set the [`synchronous`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productDelete#arguments-synchronous) parameter to `false` to run the deletion asynchronously, which returns a [`ProductDeleteOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductDeleteOperation) that you can monitor for completion status.

  If you need more granular control over product cleanup, consider using these alternative mutations:

  * [`productUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate): Update the product status to archived or unpublished instead of deleting.
  * [`productVariantsBulkDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkDelete): Delete specific variants while keeping the product.
  * [`productOptionsDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete): Delete the choices available for a product, such as size, color, or material.

  Learn more about the [product model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate/new-product-model).

  * input

  ***

* [product​Duplicate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productDuplicate)

  mutation

  Duplicates a product.

  If you need to duplicate a large product, such as one that has many [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductVariantInput) that are active at several [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/InventoryLevelInput), you might encounter timeout errors.

  To avoid these timeout errors, you can instead duplicate the product asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-10 and higher, include `synchronous: false` argument in this mutation to perform the duplication asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-07 and lower, use the asynchronous [`ProductDuplicateAsyncV2`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/mutations/productDuplicateAsyncV2).

  Metafield values are not duplicated if the unique values capability is enabled.
