  How a product can be sold and purchased through recurring billing or deferred
  purchase options. Defines the specific terms for subscriptions, pre-orders, or
  try-before-you-buy offers, including when to bill customers, when to fulfill

  Each selling plan has billing, delivery, and pricing policies that control the
  purchase experience. The plan's
  [`options`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlan#field-SellingPlan.fields.options)
  and
  [`category`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlan#field-SellingPlan.fields.category)
  help merchants organize and report on different selling strategies. Plans are
  grouped within a
  [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup)
  that associates them with
  [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
  and
  [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)
  objects.
