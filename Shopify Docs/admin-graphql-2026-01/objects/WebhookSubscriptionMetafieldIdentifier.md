description: >-
  Webhook subscriptions let you receive instant notifications when important
  events happen in a merchant's store, so you can automate workflows and keep
  your systems in sync without constantly polling for updates.


  For example, a subscription might monitor `orders/create` events and send JSON
  payloads to `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders` whenever customers place new
  orders, enabling immediate order processing workflows.


  Use the `WebhookSubscription` object to:

  - Monitor active webhook configurations

  - Access subscription details like topics, endpoints, and filtering rules

  - Retrieve creation and update timestamps for audit purposes

  - Review API versions and format settings

  - Examine metafield namespace configurations for extended data access


  Each subscription includes comprehensive configuration details such as the
  specific Shopify events being monitored, the destination endpoint (HTTP,
  EventBridge, or Pub/Sub), event filtering criteria, and payload customization
  settings. The subscription tracks its creation and modification history.


  Subscriptions can include advanced features like Shopify search syntax for
  event filtering to control

  which events trigger notifications, specific field inclusion rules to control
  which fields are included

  in the webhook payload, and metafield namespace access to capture custom store
  data. The API version

  is inherited from the app that created the webhook subscription.


  The endpoint configuration varies by type - HTTP subscriptions include
  callback URLs, EventBridge subscriptions reference AWS ARNs, and Pub/Sub
  subscriptions specify Google Cloud project and topic details. This flexibility
  allows apps to integrate webhooks with their preferred infrastructure and
  event processing systems.
