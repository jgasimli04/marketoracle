title: WebhookHttpEndpoint - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  An HTTPS endpoint that receives webhook events as POST requests, letting your
  app respond to Shopify events in real-time. This is the most common webhook
  endpoint type, allowing apps to process Shopify events through standard HTTP
  callbacks.


  For example, when setting up order notifications, your app would provide an
  HTTPS URL like `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders/create` to receive order
  creation events as JSON payloads.


  HTTP endpoints offer straightforward webhook integration with immediate event
  delivery, making them suitable for apps that need real-time notifications
  without complex infrastructure requirements.
