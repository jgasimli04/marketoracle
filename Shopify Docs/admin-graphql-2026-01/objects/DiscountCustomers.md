title: DiscountCustomers - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Defines customer targeting for discounts through specific individual
  customers. This object allows merchants to create exclusive discounts that are
  only available to explicitly selected customers.


  For example, a VIP customer appreciation discount might target specific
  high-value customers by individually selecting them, or a beta program
  discount could be offered to selected early adopters.


  Use `DiscountCustomers` to:

  - Target specific individual customers for exclusive promotions

  - Create personalized discount experiences for selected customers

  - Offer special discounts to VIP or loyal customers

  - Provide exclusive access to promotions for specific individuals


  This targeting method requires you to add each customer who should be eligible
  for the discount. For broader targeting based on customer attributes or
  segments, use
  [`DiscountCustomerSegments`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCustomerSegments)
  instead.
