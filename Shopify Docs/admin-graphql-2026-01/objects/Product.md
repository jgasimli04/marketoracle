* [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products)

  query

  Retrieves a list of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) in a store. Products are the items that merchants can sell in their store.

  Use the `products` query when you need to:

  * Build a browsing interface for a product catalog.
  * Create product [searching](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/search-syntax), [sorting](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-sortKey), and [filtering](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-query) experiences.
  * Implement product recommendations.
  * Sync product data with external systems.

  The `products` query supports [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/pagination-graphql) to handle large product catalogs and [saved searches](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#arguments-savedSearchId) for frequently used product queries.

  The `products` query returns products with their associated metadata, including:

  * Basic product information (for example, title, description, vendor, and type)
  * Product options and product variants, with their prices and inventory
  * Media attachments (for example, images and videos)
  * SEO metadata
  * Product categories and tags
  * Product availability and publishing statuses

  ***

* [product​By​Handle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productByHandle)

  query

  Deprecated

  * handle

    [String!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/String)

    required

    ### Arguments

    A unique string that identifies the product. Handles are automatically generated based on the product's title, and are always lowercase. Whitespace and special characters are replaced with a hyphen: `-`. If there are multiple consecutive whitespace or special characters, then they're replaced with a single hyphen. Whitespace or special characters at the beginning are removed. If a duplicate product title is used, then the handle is auto-incremented by one. For example, if you had two products called `Potion`, then their handles would be `potion` and `potion-1`. After a product has been created, changing the product title doesn't update the handle.

## Mutations

* [combined​Listing​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/combinedListingUpdate)

  mutation

  Add, remove and update `CombinedListing`s of a given Product.

  `CombinedListing`s are comprised of multiple products to create a single listing. There are two kinds of products used in a `CombinedListing`:

  1. Parent products
  2. Child products

  The parent product is created with a `productCreate` with a `CombinedListingRole` of `PARENT`. Once created, you can associate child products with the parent product using this mutation. Parent products represent the idea of a product (e.g. Shoe).

  Child products represent a particular option value (or combination of option values) of a parent product. For instance, with your Shoe parent product, you may have several child products representing specific colors of the shoe (e.g. Shoe - Blue). You could also have child products representing more than a single option (e.g. Shoe - Blue/Canvas, Shoe - Blue/Leather, etc...).

  The combined listing is the association of parent product to one or more child products.

  Learn more about [Combined Listings](https://shopify.dev/apps/selling-strategies/combined-listings).

    The IDs of products to be removed from the combined listing.

  * options​And​Values

    [\[Option​And​Value​Input!\]](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/OptionAndValueInput)

    The ordered options and values to be used by the combined listing. Options and values will be reordered to match the order specified here.

  ***

* [price​List​Fixed​Prices​By​Product​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/priceListFixedPricesByProductUpdate)

  mutation

  Sets or removes fixed prices for all variants of a [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) on a [`PriceList`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PriceList). Simplifies pricing management when all variants of a product should have the same price on a price list, rather than setting individual variant prices.

  When you add a fixed price for a product, all its [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) objects receive the same price on the price list. When you remove a product's fixed prices, all variant prices revert to the price list's adjustment rules.

  * prices​To​Add

    [\[Price​List​Product​Price​Input!\]](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/PriceListProductPriceInput)

    ### Arguments

    A list of `PriceListProductPriceInput` that identifies which products to update the fixed prices for.

  * prices​To​Delete​By​Product​Ids

    [\[ID!\]](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    A list of product IDs that identifies which products to remove the fixed prices for.

  * price​List​Id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    The price list to update the prices for.

  ***

* [product​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) with attributes such as title, description, vendor, and media.

  The `productCreate` mutation helps you create many products at once, avoiding the tedious or time-consuming process of adding them one by one in the Shopify admin. Common examples include creating products for a new collection, launching a new product line, or adding seasonal products.

  You can define product [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and [values](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue), allowing you to create products with different variations like sizes or colors. You can also associate media files to your products, including images and videos.

  The `productCreate` mutation only supports creating a product with its initial [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant). To create multiple product variants for a single product and manage prices, use the [`productVariantsBulkCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkCreate) mutation.

  ***

  Note

  The `productCreate` mutation has a [throttle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits#resource-based-rate-limits) that takes effect when a store has 50,000 product variants. After this threshold is reached, no more than 1,000 new product variants can be created per day.

  ***

  After you create a product, you can make subsequent edits to the product using one of the following mutations:

  * [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish): Used to publish the product and make it available to customers. The `productCreate` mutation creates products in an unpublished state by default, so you must perform a separate operation to publish the product.
  * [`productUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate): Used to update a single product, such as changing the product's title, description, vendor, or associated media.
  * [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet): Used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.

  Learn more about the [product model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate/new-product-model) and [adding product data](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate/new-product-model/add-data).

  mutation

  Duplicates a product.

  If you need to duplicate a large product, such as one that has many [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductVariantInput) that are active at several [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/InventoryLevelInput), you might encounter timeout errors.

  To avoid these timeout errors, you can instead duplicate the product asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-10 and higher, include `synchronous: false` argument in this mutation to perform the duplication asynchronously.

  In API version 2024-07 and lower, use the asynchronous [`ProductDuplicateAsyncV2`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/mutations/productDuplicateAsyncV2).

  Metafield values are not duplicated if the unique values capability is enabled.

* [product​Options​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)

  mutation

  Creates one or more [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) on a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product), such as size, color, or material. Each option includes a name, position, and a list of values. The combination of a product option and value creates a [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant).

  Use the `productOptionsCreate` mutation for the following use cases:

  * **Add product choices**: Add a new option, like "Size" (Small, Medium, Large) or "Color" (Red, Blue, Green), to an existing product so customers can select their preferred variant.
  * **Enable personalization features**: Add options such as "Engraving text" to let customers customize their purchase.
  * **Offer seasonal or limited edition products**: Add a new value (for example, "Holiday red") to an existing option to support limited-time or seasonal variants.
  * **Integrate with apps that manage product configuration**: Allow third-party apps to add options, like "Bundle size", when customers select or customize [product bundles](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/product-merchandising/bundles).
  * **Link options to metafields**: Associate a product option with a custom [metafield](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data), like "Fabric code", for richer integrations with other systems or apps.

  ***

  Note

  The `productOptionsCreate` mutation enforces strict data integrity for product options and variants. All option positions must be sequential, and every option should be used by at least one variant. If you use the [`CREATE` variant strategy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate#arguments-variantStrategy.enums.CREATE), consider the maximum allowed number of variants for each product is 2048.

  ***

  After you create product options, you can further manage a product's configuration using related mutations:

  * [`productOptionUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionUpdate)
  * [`productOptionsReorder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsReorder)

  ***

* [product​Options​Delete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete)

  mutation

  Deletes one or more [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) from a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product). Product options define the choices available for a product, such as size, color, or material.

  ***

  Caution

  Removing an option can affect a product's [variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) and their configuration. Deleting an option might also delete associated option values and, depending on the chosen [strategy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productoptionsdelete#arguments-strategy), might affect variants.

  ***

  Use the `productOptionsDelete` mutation for the following use cases:

  * **Simplify product configuration**: Remove obsolete or unnecessary options (for example, discontinue "Material" if all variants are now the same material).
  * **Clean up after seasonal or limited-time offerings**: Delete options that are no longer relevant (for example, "Holiday edition").
  * **Automate catalog management**: Enable apps or integrations to programmatically remove options as product data changes.

  ***

  Note

  The `productOptionsDelete` mutation enforces strict data integrity for product options and variants. All option positions must remain sequential, and every remaining option must be used by at least one variant.

  ***

  After you delete a product option, you can further manage a product's configuration using related mutations:

  * [`productOptionsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)
  * [`productOptionUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionUpdate)

  * strategy

    [Product​Option​Delete​Strategy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/ProductOptionDeleteStrategy)

    Default:DEFAULT

    The strategy defines which behavior the mutation should observe,such as how to handle a situation where deleting an option would result in duplicate variants.

  ***

* [product​Options​Reorder](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsReorder)

  mutation

  Reorders the [options](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) and [option values](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue) on a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product), updating the order in which [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) are presented to customers.

  The `productOptionsReorder` mutation accepts a list of product options, each identified by `id` or `name`, and an optional list of values (also by `id` or `name`) specifying the new order. The order of options in the mutation's input determines their new positions (for example, the first option becomes `option1`). The order of values within each option determines their new positions. The mutation recalculates the order of variants based on the new option and value order.

  Suppose a product has the following variants:

  1. `"Red / Small"`
  2. `"Green / Medium"`
  3. `"Blue / Small"`

  You reorder options and values:

  ```
  options: [
  { name: "Size", values: [{ name: "Small" }, { name: "Medium" }] },
  { name: "Color", values: [{ name: "Green" }, { name: "Red" }, { name: "Blue" }] }
  ]
  ```

  The resulting variant order will be:

  1. `"Small / Green"`
  2. `"Small / Red"`
  3. `"Small / Blue"`
  4. `"Medium / Green"`

  Use the `productOptionsReorder` mutation for the following use cases:

  * **Change the order of product options**: For example, display "Color" before "Size" in a store.
  * **Reorder option values within an option**: For example, show "Red" before "Blue" in a color picker.
  * **Control the order of product variants**: The order of options and their values determines the sequence in which variants are listed and selected.
  * **Highlight best-selling options**: Present the most popular or relevant options and values first.
  * **Promote merchandising strategies**: Highlight seasonal colors, limited editions, or featured sizes.

  ***

  Note

  The `productOptionsReorder` mutation enforces strict data integrity for product options and variants. All option positions must be sequential, and every option should be used by at least one variant.

  ***

  After you reorder product options, you can further manage a product's configuration using related mutations:

  * [`productOptionsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)
  * [`productOptionsDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete)

  ***

* [product​Option​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates an [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption) on a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product), such as size, color, or material. Each option includes a name, position, and a list of values. The combination of a product option and value creates a [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant).

  Use the `productOptionUpdate` mutation for the following use cases:

  * **Update product choices**: Modify an existing option, like "Size" (Small, Medium, Large) or "Color" (Red, Blue, Green), so customers can select their preferred variant.
  * **Enable personalization features**: Update an option (for example, "Engraving text") to let customers customize their purchase.
  * **Offer seasonal or limited edition products**: Update a value (for example, "Holiday red") on an existing option to support limited-time or seasonal variants.
  * **Integrate with apps that manage product configuration**: Allow third-party apps to update options, like "Bundle size", when customers select or customize [product bundles](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/product-merchandising/bundles).

  * variant​Strategy

    [Product​Option​Update​Variant​Strategy](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/ProductOptionUpdateVariantStrategy)

    The strategy defines which behavior the mutation should observe regarding variants, such as creating variants or deleting them in response to option values to add or to delete. If not provided or set to null, the strategy `LEAVE_AS_IS` will be used.

  ***

* [product​Set](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet)

  mutation

  Performs multiple operations to create or update products in a single request.

  Use the `productSet` mutation to sync information from an external data source into Shopify, manage large product catalogs, and perform batch updates. The mutation is helpful for bulk product management, including price adjustments, inventory updates, and product lifecycle management.

  The behavior of `productSet` depends on the type of field it's modifying:

  * **For list fields**: Creates new entries, updates existing entries, and deletes existing entries that aren't included in the mutation's input. Common examples of list fields include [`collections`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.collections), [`metafields`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.metafields), and [`variants`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet#arguments-input.fields.variants).

  * **For all other field types**: Updates only the included fields. Any omitted fields will remain unchanged.

  ***

  Note

  By default, stores have a limit of 2048 product variants for each product.

  ***

  You can run `productSet` in one of the following modes:

  * **Synchronously**: Returns the updated product in the response.
  * **Asynchronously**: Returns a [`ProductSetOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductSetOperation) object. Use the [`productOperation`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productOperation) query to check the status of the operation and retrieve details of the updated product and its product variants.

  If you need to only manage product variants, then use one of the following mutations:

  * [`productVariantsBulkCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkCreate)
  * [`productVariantsBulkUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkUpdate)
  * [`productVariantsBulkDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkDelete)

  If you need to only manage product options, then use one of the following mutations:

  * [`productOptionsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)
  * [`productOptionUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionUpdate)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The properties of the newly created or updated product.

  * synchronous

    [Boolean](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/Boolean)

    Default:true

    Whether the mutation should be run synchronously or asynchronously.

    If `true`, the mutation will return the updated `product`.

    If `false`, the mutation will return a `productSetOperation`.

    Defaults to `true`.

    Setting `synchronous: false` may be desirable depending on the input complexity/size, and should be used if you are experiencing timeouts.

    **Note**: When run in the context of a [bulk operation](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports), the mutation will always run synchronously and this argument will be ignored.

  * identifier

    [Product​Set​Identifiers](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/ProductSetIdentifiers)

    Specifies the identifier that will be used to lookup the resource.

  ***

* [product​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) with attributes such as title, description, vendor, and media.

  The `productUpdate` mutation helps you modify many products at once, avoiding the tedious or time-consuming process of updating them one by one in the Shopify admin. Common examples including updating product details like status or tags.

  The `productUpdate` mutation doesn't support updating [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant). To update multiple product variants for a single product and manage prices, use the [`productVariantsBulkUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkUpdate) mutation.

  ***

  Note

  The `productUpdate` mutation has a [throttle](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/rate-limits#resource-based-rate-limits) that takes effect when a store has 50,000 product variants. After this threshold is reached, no more than 1,000 new product variants can be updated per day.

  ***

  After updating a product, you can make additional changes using one of the following mutations:

  * [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet): Used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.
  * [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish): Used to publish the product and make it available to customers, if the product is currently unpublished.

  ***

* [product​Variant​Append​Media](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantAppendMedia)

  mutation

  Appends existing media from a product to specific variants of that product, creating associations between media files and particular product options. This allows different variants to showcase relevant images or videos.

  For example, a t-shirt product might have color variants where each color variant displays only the images showing that specific color, helping customers see exactly what they're purchasing.

  Use `ProductVariantAppendMedia` to:

  * Associate specific images with product variants for accurate display
  * Build variant-specific media management in product interfaces
  * Implement automated media assignment based on variant attributes

  The operation links existing product media to variants without duplicating files, maintaining efficient media storage while enabling variant-specific displays.

* [product​Variants​Bulk​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkCreate)

  mutation

  Creates multiple [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) for a single [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) in one operation. You can run this mutation directly or as part of a [bulk operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports) for large-scale catalog updates.

  Use the `productVariantsBulkCreate` mutation to efficiently add new product variants—such as different sizes, colors, or materials—to an existing product. The mutation is helpful if you need to add product variants in bulk, such as importing from an external system.

  The mutation supports:

  * Creating variants with custom option values
  * Associating media (for example, images, videos, and 3D models) with the product or its variants
  * Handling complex product configurations

  ***

* [product​Variants​Bulk​Delete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkDelete)

  mutation

  Deletes multiple variants in a single [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product). Specify the product ID and an array of variant IDs to remove variants in bulk. You can call this mutation directly or through the [`bulkOperationRunMutation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/bulkOperationRunMutation) mutation. Returns the updated product and any [`UserError`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/UserError) objects.

* [product​Variants​Bulk​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates multiple [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) for a single [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) in one operation. You can run this mutation directly or as part of a [bulk operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports) for large-scale catalog updates.

  Use the `productVariantsBulkUpdate` mutation to efficiently modify product variants—such as different sizes, colors, or materials—associated with an existing product. The mutation is helpful if you need to update a product's variants in bulk, such as importing from an external system.

  The mutation supports:

  * Updating variants with custom option values
  * Associating media (for example, images, videos, and 3D models) with the product or its variants
  * Handling complex product configurations

  ***

  Note

  By default, stores have a limit of 2048 product variants for each product.

  ***

  After creating variants, you can make additional changes using the [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet) mutation, which is used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.

  You can also specifically manage product options through related mutations:

  * [`productOptionsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)
  * [`productOptionUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionUpdate)
  * [`productOptionsReorder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsReorder)
  * [`productOptionsDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete)
