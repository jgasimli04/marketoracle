description: >-
  The market’s web presence, which defines its SEO strategy. This can be a
  different domain

  (e.g. `example.ca`), subdomain (e.g. `ca.example.com`), or subfolders of the
  primary

  domain (e.g. `example.com/en-ca`). Each web presence comprises one or more
  language

  variants. If a market does not have its own web presence, it is accessible on
  the shop’s

  primary domain via [country

  selectors](https://shopify.dev/themes/internationalization/multiple-currencies-languages#the-country-selector).


  Note: while the domain/subfolders defined by a market’s web presence are not
  applicable to

  custom storefronts, which must manage their own domains and routing, the
  languages chosen

  here do govern [the languages available on the Storefront

  API](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/internationalization/multiple-languages)
  for the countries in

  this market.

# Market​Web​Presence

object

Requires `read_markets` for queries and both `read_markets` as well as `write_markets` for mutations.

The market’s web presence, which defines its SEO strategy. This can be a different domain (e.g. `example.ca`), subdomain (e.g. `ca.example.com`), or subfolders of the primary domain (e.g. `example.com/en-ca`). Each web presence comprises one or more language variants. If a market does not have its own web presence, it is accessible on the shop’s primary domain via [country selectors](https://shopify.dev/themes/internationalization/multiple-currencies-languages#the-country-selector).

Note: while the domain/subfolders defined by a market’s web presence are not applicable to custom storefronts, which must manage their own domains and routing, the languages chosen here do govern [the languages available on the Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/internationalization/multiple-languages) for the countries in this market.
