title: CollectionPublication - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Represents the publication status and settings for a collection across
  different sales channels. This tracks where collections are published, when
  they were published, and any channel-specific configuration.


  For example, a "Holiday Gifts" collection might be published to the online
  store and Facebook Shop but not to the POS channel, with different publication
  dates for each channel based on marketing strategy.


  Use `CollectionPublication` to:

  - Track collection visibility across multiple sales channels

  - Manage channel-specific collection settings and availability

  - Monitor publication history and timing for collections

  - Control where collections appear in customer-facing channels

  - Implement channel-specific collection management workflows


  Each publication record includes the channel information, publication status,
  and timing details. This enables merchants to control collection visibility
  strategically across their sales channels.


  Collections can have different publication settings per channel, allowing for
  targeted marketing and inventory management. For instance, wholesale
  collections might only be published to B2B channels while retail collections
  appear in consumer-facing channels.


  The publication system integrates with Shopify's broader channel management,
  ensuring collections appear consistently across the merchant's sales ecosystem
  while respecting channel-specific rules and permissions.
