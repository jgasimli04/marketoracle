title: SubscriptionLine - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  A product line item within a
  [`SubscriptionContract`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract).
  Each line represents a specific product variant that the customer subscribes
  to, including its quantity, pricing, and whether shipping is required.


  The line maintains references to the
  [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant),
  [`SellingPlan`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlan),
  and custom
  [`Attribute`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Attribute)
  objects. It tracks the current price and any scheduled price changes through
  its
  [`pricingPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionPricingPolicy).
  You can modify lines through
  [`SubscriptionDraft`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionDraft)
  objects without affecting the original contract until you commit changes.
