## Mutations

* [delegate​Access​Token​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/delegateAccessTokenCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [`DelegateAccessToken`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DelegateAccessToken) with a subset of the parent token's permissions.

  Delegate access tokens enable secure permission delegation to subsystems or services that need limited access to shop resources. Each token inherits only the scopes you specify, ensuring subsystems operate with minimal required permissions rather than full app access.
