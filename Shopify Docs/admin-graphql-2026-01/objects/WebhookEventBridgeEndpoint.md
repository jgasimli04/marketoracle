title: WebhookEventBridgeEndpoint - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Connects your app to Amazon EventBridge so you can receive Shopify webhook
  events and process them through AWS's event-driven architecture. This gives
  you enterprise-grade scalability and lets you tap into the full AWS ecosystem
  for handling webhook traffic.


  For example, when a customer places an order, Shopify can publish the order
  creation event directly to your EventBridge partner source, allowing your AWS
  infrastructure to process the event through Lambda functions, SQS queues, or
  other AWS services.


  EventBridge endpoints provide enterprise-grade event routing and processing
  capabilities, making them ideal for apps that need to handle high-volume
  webhook traffic or integrate deeply with AWS services.
