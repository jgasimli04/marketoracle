## Mutations

* [fulfillment​Order​Hold](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderHold)

  mutation

  Applies a fulfillment hold on a fulfillment order.

  As of the [2025-01 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/apply-multiple-holds-to-a-single-fulfillment-order), the mutation can be successfully executed on fulfillment orders that are already on hold. To place multiple holds on a fulfillment order, apps need to supply the [handle](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentHold#field-handle) field. Each app can place up to 10 active holds per fulfillment order. If an app attempts to place more than this, the mutation will return [a user error indicating that the limit has been reached](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderHoldUserErrorCode#value-fulfillmentorderholdlimitreached). The app would need to release one of its existing holds before being able to apply a new one.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

  * fulfillment​Hold

    [Fulfillment​Order​Hold​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/FulfillmentOrderHoldInput)
