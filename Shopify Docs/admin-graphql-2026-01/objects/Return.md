title: Return - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  The `Return` object represents the intent of a buyer to ship one or more items
  from an order back to a merchant

  or a third-party fulfillment location. A return is associated with an
  [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  and can include multiple return [line
  items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem).

  Each return has a
  [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps#return-statuses),

  which indicates the state of the return.


  Use the `Return` object to capture the financial, logistical,

  and business intent of a return. For example, you can identify eligible items
  for a return and issue customers

  a refund for returned items on behalf of the merchant.

# Return

object

Requires `read_returns` access scope or `read_marketplace_returns` access scope.

The `Return` object represents the intent of a buyer to ship one or more items from an order back to a merchant or a third-party fulfillment location. A return is associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and can include multiple return [line items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem). Each return has a [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps#return-statuses), which indicates the state of the return.

Use the `Return` object to capture the financial, logistical, and business intent of a return. For example, you can identify eligible items for a return and issue customers a refund for returned items on behalf of the merchant.

Learn more about providing a [return management workflow](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/build-return-management) for merchants. You can also manage [exchanges](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-exchanges), [reverse fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-fulfillment-orders), and [reverse deliveries](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-deliveries) on behalf of merchants.

## Queries

* [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/return)

  query

  Retrieves a return by its ID. A return represents the intent of a buyer to ship one or more items from an order back to a merchant or a third-party fulfillment location.

  Use the `return` query to retrieve information associated with the following workflows:

  * [Managing returns](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/build-return-management)

  * [Tracking reverse fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-fulfillment-orders)

  A return is associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and can include multiple return [line items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem). Each return has a [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps#return-statuses), which indicates the state of the return.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

* [return​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a return from an existing order that has at least one fulfilled [line item](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem) that hasn't yet been refunded. If you create a return on an archived order, then the order is automatically unarchived.

  Use the `returnCreate` mutation when your workflow involves [approving](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnApproveRequest) or [declining](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnDeclineRequest) requested returns outside of the Shopify platform.

  The `returnCreate` mutation performs the following actions:

  * Creates a return in the `OPEN` state, and assumes that the return request from the customer has already been approved
  * Creates a [reverse fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-fulfillment-orders), and enables you to create a [reverse delivery](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-deliveries) for the reverse fulfillment order
  * Creates a sales agreement with a `RETURN` reason, which links to all sales created for the return or exchange
  * Generates sales records that reverse the sales records for the items being returned
  * Generates sales records for any exchange line items

  After you've created a return, use the [`return`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/return) query to retrieve the return by its ID.

  ***

* [return​Process](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnProcess)

This mutation confirms the quantities for [`ReturnLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ReturnLineItem) and [`ExchangeLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ExchangeLineItem) objects previously created on the [`Return`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return).

  For returned items, you specify how to handle them through dispositions such as restocking or disposal. The mutation creates [`FulfillmentOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) objects for exchange items and records all transactions in the merchant's financial reports. You can optionally issue refunds through financial transfers, apply refund duties, and refund shipping costs.

* [return​Request](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnRequest)

  mutation

  Use this mutation when customers initiate returns that need review. After creating a requested return, use [`returnApproveRequest`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnApproveRequest) to approve it or [`returnDeclineRequest`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnDeclineRequest) to decline it.

  For returns that should be immediately open for processing, use the [`returnCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnCreate) mutation instead.
