## Mutations

* [comment​Approve](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/commentApprove)

  mutation

  Approves a pending comment, making it visible to store visitors on the associated blog article.

  For example, when a customer submits a question about a product in a blog post, merchants can approve the comment to make it publicly visible.

  Use the `commentApprove` mutation to:

  * Publish pending comments after review
  * Enable customer discussions on blog articles
  * Maintain quality control over comments

  Once approved, the comment becomes visible to all store visitors.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the comment to be approved.

  ***

* [comment​Not​Spam](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/commentNotSpam)

  mutation

  Reverses a spam classification on a comment, restoring it to normal moderation status. This mutation allows merchants to change their decision when a comment has been manually marked as spam.

  For example, when a merchant reviews comments marked as spam and finds a legitimate customer question, they can use this mutation to restore the comment's normal status and make it eligible for approval.

  Use the `commentNotSpam` mutation to:

  * Unmark comments that were marked as spam
  * Restore comments to normal moderation status
  * Move comments back to the approval queue

  This action changes the comment's status from spam back to pending, where it can then be approved or managed according to standard moderation practices.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the comment to be marked as not spam.

  ***

* [comment​Spam](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/commentSpam)

  mutation

  Marks a comment as spam, removing it from public view. This mutation enables merchants to quickly handle unwanted promotional content, malicious links, or other spam that appears in blog discussions.

  For example, when a comment contains suspicious links to unrelated products or services, merchants can mark it as spam to immediately hide it from customers.

  Use the `commentSpam` mutation to:

  * Hide promotional or malicious comments from public view
  * Protect customers from potentially harmful links
  * Maintain professional discussion quality on blog articles

  Spam-marked comments can be reviewed later and potentially restored using the `commentNotSpam` mutation if they were incorrectly classified.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the comment to be marked as spam.
