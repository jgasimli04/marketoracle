      - Example:

        * `test:true`

        Filter by the order weight. This filter supports both exact values and ranges, and is to be used to filter orders by the total weight of all items (excluding packaging). It takes a unit of measurement as a suffix. It accepts the following units: g, kg, lb, oz.

      - Example:

        * `total_weight:10.5kg`

        Filter by the date and time of the customer's most recent abandoned checkout. An abandoned checkout occurs when a customer adds items to their cart, begins the checkout process, but leaves the site without completing their purchase.

      - Example:

        * `last_abandoned_order_date:'2024-04-01T10:00:00Z'`
        * `last_abandoned_order_date: >='2024-01-01'`

        Filter by the customer's last name.

      - Example:

        * `last_name:Reeves`

        Filter by the date and time that the order was placed by the customer. Use this query filter to check if a customer has placed at least one order within a specified date range.

      - Example:

        * `order_date:'2024-02-20T00:00:00Z'`
        * `order_date: >='2024-01-01'`
        * `order_date:'2024-01-01..2024-03-31'`

        Filter by the total number of orders a customer has placed.

      - Example:

        * `orders_count:5`

        The phone number of the customer, used to communicate information about orders and for the purposes of SMS marketing campaigns. You can use a wildcard value to filter the query by customers who have a phone number specified.

      - Example:

        * `phone:+18005550100`
        * `phone:*`

        Filter by the [state](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer#field-state) of the customer's account with the shop. This filter is only valid when [Classic Customer Accounts](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CustomerAccountsV2#field-customerAccountsVersion) is active.

      - Example:

        * `state:ENABLED`
        * `state:INVITED`
        * `state:DISABLED`
        * `state:DECLINED`

        Filter by the tags that are associated with the customer. This query parameter accepts multiple tags separated by commas.

      - Example:

        * `tag:'VIP'`
        * `tag:'Wholesale,Repeat'`

        Filter by the tags that aren't associated with the customer. This query parameter accepts multiple tags separated by commas.

      - Example:

        * `tag_not:'Prospect'`
        * `tag_not:'Test,Internal'`

        Filter by the total amount of money a customer has spent across all orders.

      - Example:

        * `total_spent:100.50`
        * `total_spent:50.00`
        * `total_spent:>100.50`
        * `total_spent:>50.00`

        The date and time, matching a whole day, when the customer's information was last updated.

        Example:

        * `updated_at:2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
        * `updated_at:<now`
        * `updated_at:<=2024`
