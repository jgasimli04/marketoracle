## Mutations

* [store​Credit​Account​Credit](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/storeCreditAccountCredit)

  mutation

  Adds funds to a [`StoreCreditAccount`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/StoreCreditAccount) by creating a [`StoreCreditAccountCreditTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/StoreCreditAccountCreditTransaction). The mutation accepts either a store credit account ID, a [`Customer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer) ID, or a [`CompanyLocation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CompanyLocation) ID. When you provide a customer or company location ID, it automatically creates an account if one doesn't exist for the specified currency.

  Store credit accounts are currency-specific. A single owner can have multiple accounts, each holding a different currency. Use the most appropriate currency for the given store credit account owner.

  Credits can optionally include an expiration date.
