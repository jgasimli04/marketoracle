description: >-
  An order during an active edit session with all proposed changes applied but
  not yet committed. When you begin editing an order with the
  [`orderEditBegin`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditBegin)
  mutation, the system creates a
  [`CalculatedOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CalculatedOrder)
  that shows how the
  [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
  will look after your changes. The calculated order tracks the original order
  state and all staged modifications (added or removed
  [`LineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem)
  objects, quantity adjustments, discount changes, and
  [`ShippingLine`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ShippingLine)
  updates). Use the calculated order to preview the financial impact of edits
  before committing them with the
  [`orderEditCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditCommit)
  mutation.

# Calculated​Order

object

Requires `read_order_edits` access scope.

An order during an active edit session with all proposed changes applied but not yet committed. When you begin editing an order with the [`orderEditBegin`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditBegin) mutation, the system creates a [`CalculatedOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CalculatedOrder) that shows how the [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) will look after your changes. The calculated order tracks the original order state and all staged modifications (added or removed [`LineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem) objects, quantity adjustments, discount changes, and [`ShippingLine`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ShippingLine) updates). Use the calculated order to preview the financial impact of edits before committing them with the [`orderEditCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditCommit) mutation.

  Order editing follows a three-step workflow: Begin the edit with [`orderEditBegin`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditBegin), apply changes using mutations like [`orderEditAddVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditAddVariant) or [`orderEditSetQuantity`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditSetQuantity), and then save the changes with the [`orderEditCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditCommit) mutation.
