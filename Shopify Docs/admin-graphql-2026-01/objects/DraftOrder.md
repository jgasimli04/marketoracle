  useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:


  - Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere.
  When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.

  - Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.

  - Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't
  displayed in a shop's inventory.

  - Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.

  - Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.

  - Take pre-orders.


  For draft orders in multiple currencies `presentment_money` is the source of

  estimate of what the merchant might receive in their shop currency.

## Mutations

* [draft​Order​Complete](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderComplete)

  mutation

  Completes a [draft order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder) and converts it into a [regular order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The order appears in the merchant's orders list, and the customer can be notified about their order.

  Use the `draftOrderComplete` mutation when a merchant is ready to finalize a draft order and create a real order in their store. The `draftOrderComplete` mutation also supports sales channel attribution for tracking order sources using the [`sourceName`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderComplete#arguments-sourceName) argument, [cart validation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/cart-checkout-validation) controls for app integrations, and detailed error reporting for failed completions.

  You can complete a draft order with different [payment scenarios](https://help.shopify.com/manual/fulfillment/managing-orders/payments):

  * Mark the order as paid immediately.
  * Set the order as payment pending using [payment terms](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PaymentTerms).
  * Specify a custom payment amount.
  * Select a specific payment gateway.

  ***

  Note

  When completing a draft order, inventory is [reserved](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/inventory-management-apps#inventory-states) for the items in the order. This means the items will no longer be available for other customers to purchase. Make sure to verify inventory availability before completing the draft order.

* [draft​Order​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [draft order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder) with attributes such as customer information, line items, shipping and billing addresses, and payment terms. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to:

  * Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
  * Send invoices to customers with a secure checkout link.
  * Use custom items to represent additional costs or products not in inventory.
  * Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
  * Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
  * Take pre-orders.

  After creating a draft order, you can:

  * Send an invoice to the customer using the [`draftOrderInvoiceSend`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderInvoiceSend) mutation.
  * Complete the draft order using the [`draftOrderComplete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderComplete) mutation.
  * Update the draft order using the [`draftOrderUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderUpdate) mutation.
  * Duplicate a draft order using the [`draftOrderDuplicate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderDuplicate) mutation.
  * Delete the draft order using the [`draftOrderDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderDelete) mutation.

  ***

  Note

  When you create a draft order, you can't [reserve or hold inventory](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/inventory-management-apps#inventory-states) for the items in the order by default. However, you can reserve inventory using the [`reserveInventoryUntil`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderCreate#arguments-input.fields.reserveInventoryUntil) input.

  ***

    [Draft​Order​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/DraftOrderInput)

    Deprecated

    ### Arguments

  * id

    [ID](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    The ID of the draft order to duplicate.

  ***

* [draft​Order​Invoice​Send](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderInvoiceSend)

  mutation

  Sends an invoice email for a [`DraftOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder). The invoice includes a secure checkout link for reviewing and paying for the order. Use the [`email`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderInvoiceSend#arguments-email) argument to customize the email, such as the subject and message.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    Specifies the draft order to send the invoice for.

  * email

    [Email​Input](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/EmailInput)

    Specifies the draft order invoice email fields.

  ***

* [draft​Order​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates a draft order.

  If a checkout has been started for a draft order, any update to the draft will unlink the checkout. Checkouts are created but not immediately completed when opening the merchant credit card modal in the admin, and when a buyer opens the invoice URL. This is usually fine, but there is an edge case where a checkout is in progress and the draft is updated before the checkout completes. This will not interfere with the checkout and order creation, but if the link from draft to checkout is broken the draft will remain open even after the order is created.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    Specifies the draft order to update.

  * input

    [Draft​Order​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/DraftOrderInput)

    required

    The draft order properties to update.
