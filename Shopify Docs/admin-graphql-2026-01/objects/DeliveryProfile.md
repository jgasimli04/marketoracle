description: >-
  A shipping profile that defines shipping rates for specific

  objects and
  [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  [`Location`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location)
  objects to which zones, and at what rates.


  Profiles can associate with
  [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup)
  objects to provide custom shipping rules for subscriptions, such as free
  shipping or restricted delivery zones. The default profile applies to all
  products that aren't assigned to other profiles.

  mutation

  Creates a [`DeliveryProfile`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DeliveryProfile) that defines shipping rates for specific products and locations.

Each profile contains [`DeliveryProfileLocationGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DeliveryProfileLocationGroup) objects that specify which [`Location`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location) objects ship to which [`DeliveryZone`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DeliveryZone) objects with specific [`DeliveryMethodDefinition`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DeliveryMethodDefinition) objects and rates.
