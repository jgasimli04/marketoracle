title: ProductVariant - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  The `ProductVariant` object represents a version of a

  [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)

  that comes in more than one
  [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption),

  such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options
  for size and color, then a small,

  blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be
  another.


  Use the `ProductVariant` object to manage the full lifecycle and configuration
  of a product's variants. Common

  use cases for using the `ProductVariant` object include:


  - Tracking inventory for each variant

  - Setting unique prices for each variant

  - Assigning barcodes and SKUs to connect variants to fulfillment services

  - Attaching variant-specific images and media

  - Setting delivery and tax requirements

  - Supporting product bundles, subscriptions, and selling plans


  A `ProductVariant` is associated with a parent

  [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product)
  object.

  `ProductVariant` serves as the central link between a product's merchandising
  configuration, inventory,

  pricing, fulfillment, and sales channels within the GraphQL Admin API schema.
  Each variant

  can reference other GraphQL types such as:


  -
  [`InventoryItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem):
  Used for inventory tracking

  - [`Image`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Image):
  Used for variant-specific images

  -
  [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup):
  Used for subscriptions and selling plans

## Queries

* [product​Variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productVariant)

  query

  Retrieves a [product variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) by its ID.

  A product variant is a specific version of a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption), such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options for size and color, then a small, blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be another.

  Use the `productVariant` query when you need to:

  * Access essential product variant data (for example, title, price, image, and metafields).
  * Build product detail pages and manage inventory.
  * Handle international sales with localized pricing and content.
  * Manage product variants that are part of a bundle or selling plan.

  Retrieves a list of [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) associated with a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product).

  A product variant is a specific version of a product that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption), such as size or color.

  Use the `productVariants` query when you need to:

  * Search for product variants by attributes such as SKU, barcode, or inventory quantity.
  * Filter product variants by attributes, such as whether they're gift cards or have custom metafields.
  * Fetch product variants for bulk operations, such as updating prices or inventory.
  * Preload data for product variants, such as inventory items, selected options, or associated products.

  The `productVariants` query supports [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/pagination-graphql) to handle large product catalogs and [saved searches](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productVariants#arguments-savedSearchId) for frequently used product variant queries.

  The `productVariants` query returns product variants with their associated metadata, including:

## Mutations

* [product​Variant​Append​Media](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantAppendMedia)

  mutation

  Appends existing media from a product to specific variants of that product, creating associations between media files and particular product options. This allows different variants to showcase relevant images or videos.

  For example, a t-shirt product might have color variants where each color variant displays only the images showing that specific color, helping customers see exactly what they're purchasing.

  Use `ProductVariantAppendMedia` to:

  * Associate specific images with product variants for accurate display
  * Build variant-specific media management in product interfaces
  * Implement automated media assignment based on variant attributes

  The operation links existing product media to variants without duplicating files, maintaining efficient media storage while enabling variant-specific displays.

  Each bundle variant can contain up to 30 component variants with specified quantities. After an app assigns components to a bundle, only that app can manage those components.

  ***

  Note

  For most use cases, use [`productBundleCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productBundleCreate) instead, which creates product fixed bundles. `productVariantRelationshipBulkUpdate` is for [variant fixed bundles](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/product-merchandising/bundles/add-variant-fixed-bundle), where each variant has its own component configuration.

  mutation

  Creates multiple [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) for a single [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) in one operation. You can run this mutation directly or as part of a [bulk operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports) for large-scale catalog updates.

  Use the `productVariantsBulkCreate` mutation to efficiently add new product variants—such as different sizes, colors, or materials—to an existing product. The mutation is helpful if you need to add product variants in bulk, such as importing from an external system.

  The mutation supports:

  * Creating variants with custom option values
  * Associating media (for example, images, videos, and 3D models) with the product or its variants
  * Handling complex product configurations

  ***

  Note

  By default, stores have a limit of 2048 product variants for each product.

  ***

  * [`productVariantsBulkUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkUpdate): Updates multiple product variants for a single product in one operation.
  * [`productSet`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productSet): Used to perform multiple operations on products, such as creating or modifying product options and variants.

  You can also specifically manage product options through related mutations:

  * [`productOptionsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsCreate)

* [product​Variants​Bulk​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates multiple [product variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) for a single [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) in one operation. You can run this mutation directly or as part of a [bulk operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/imports) for large-scale catalog updates.

  Use the `productVariantsBulkUpdate` mutation to efficiently modify product variants—such as different sizes, colors, or materials—associated with an existing product. The mutation is helpful if you need to update a product's variants in bulk, such as importing from an external system.

  The mutation supports:

  * Updating variants with custom option values
  * Associating media (for example, images, videos, and 3D models) with the product or its variants
  * Handling complex product configurations

  ***

  Note

  ***

* [quantity​Pricing​By​Variant​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/quantityPricingByVariantUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates quantity pricing on a [`PriceList`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PriceList) for specific [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) objects.
