title: SubscriptionDraft - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  The `SubscriptionDraft` object represents a draft version of a

  [subscription
  contract](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract)

  before it's committed. It serves as a staging area for making changes to an
  existing subscription or creating

  a new one. The draft allows you to preview and modify various aspects of a
  subscription before applying the changes.


  Use the `SubscriptionDraft` object to:


  - Add, remove, or modify subscription lines and their quantities

  - Manage discounts (add, remove, or update manual and code-based discounts)

  - Configure delivery options and shipping methods

  - Set up billing and delivery policies

  - Manage customer payment methods

  - Add custom attributes and notes to generated orders

  - Configure billing cycles and next billing dates

  - Preview the projected state of the subscription


  Each `SubscriptionDraft` object maintains a projected state that shows how the
  subscription will look after the changes

  are committed. This allows you to preview the impact of your modifications
  before applying them. The draft can be

  associated with an existing subscription contract (for modifications) or used
  to create a new subscription.


  The draft remains in a draft state until it's committed, at which point the
  changes are applied to the subscription

  contract and the draft is no longer accessible.

  ***

* [subscription​Contract​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionContractCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a subscription contract draft, which is an intention to create a new subscription. The draft lets you incrementally build and modify subscription details before committing them to create the actual [`SubscriptionContract`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract).

  The mutation requires [`Customer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer) information, billing details, and contract configuration including the [`SubscriptionBillingPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionBillingPolicy) and [`SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy). You can specify the [`CustomerPaymentMethod`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CustomerPaymentMethod), the [`MailingAddress`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/MailingAddress) for shipping, and subscription intervals.

  After you create the draft, you can either modify it with the [`subscriptionDraftUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftUpdate) mutation or finalize and create the active subscription contract with [`subscriptionDraftCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftCommit).

  mutation

  Creates a draft of an existing [`SubscriptionContract`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract). The draft captures the current state of the contract and allows incremental modifications through draft mutations such as [`subscriptionDraftLineAdd`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftLineAdd), [`subscriptionDraftDiscountAdd`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftDiscountAdd), and [`subscriptionDraftUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftUpdate).

  Changes remain in draft state and don't affect the live contract until committed. After you've made all necessary changes to the draft, commit it using [`subscriptionDraftCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/subscriptionDraftCommit) to apply the updates to the original contract.
