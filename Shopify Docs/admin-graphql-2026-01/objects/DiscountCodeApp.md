## Mutations

* [discount​Code​App​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/discountCodeAppCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a code discount. The discount type must be provided by an app extension that uses [Shopify Functions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/functions). Functions can implement [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/order-discounts), [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/product-discounts), or [shipping](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions/reference/shipping-discounts) discount functions. Use this mutation with Shopify Functions when you need custom logic beyond [Shopify's native discount types](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/discount-types).

  For example, use this mutation to create a code discount using an app's "Volume" discount type that applies a percentage off when customers purchase more than the minimum quantity of a product. For an example implementation, refer to [our tutorial](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts/build-discount-function).
