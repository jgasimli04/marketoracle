title: AppCredit - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Represents monetary credits that merchants can apply toward future app
  purchases, subscriptions, or usage-based billing within their Shopify store.
  App credits provide a flexible way to offer refunds, promotional credits, or
  compensation without processing external payments.


  For example, if a merchant experiences service downtime, an app might issue
  credits equivalent to the affected billing period. These credits can apply to
  future charges, reducing the merchant's next invoice or extending their
  subscription period.


  Use the `AppCredit` object to:

  - Issue refunds for service interruptions or billing disputes

  - Provide promotional credits for new merchant onboarding

  - Compensate merchants for app-related issues or downtime

  - Create loyalty rewards or referral bonuses within your billing system

  - Track credit balances and application history for accounting purposes


  For comprehensive billing strategies and credit management patterns, see the
  [subscription billing
  guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/subscription-billing).
