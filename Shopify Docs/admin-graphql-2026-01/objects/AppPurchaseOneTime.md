title: AppPurchaseOneTime - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Represents a one-time purchase of app services or features by a merchant,
  tracking the transaction details and status throughout the billing lifecycle.
  This object captures essential information about non-recurring charges,
  including price and merchant acceptance status.


  One-time purchases are particularly valuable for apps offering premium
  features, professional services, or digital products that don't require
  ongoing subscriptions. For instance, a photography app might sell premium
  filters as one-time purchases, while a marketing app could charge for
  individual campaign setups or advanced analytics reports.


  Use the `AppPurchaseOneTime` object to:

  - Track the status of individual feature purchases and service charges

  - Track payment status for premium content or digital products

  - Access purchase details to enable or disable features based on payment
  status


  The purchase status indicates whether the charge is pending merchant approval,
  has been accepted and processed, or was declined. This status tracking is
  crucial for apps that need to conditionally enable features based on
  successful payment completion.


  Purchase records include creation timestamps, pricing details, and test flags
  to distinguish between production charges and development testing. The test
  flag ensures that development and staging environments don't generate actual
  charges while maintaining realistic billing flow testing.


  For detailed implementation patterns and billing best practices, see the
  [one-time-charges
  page](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/one-time-charges).

## Mutations

* [app​Purchase​One​Time​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/appPurchaseOneTimeCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a one-time charge for app features or services that don't require recurring billing. This mutation is ideal for apps that sell individual features, premium content, or services on a per-use basis rather than subscription models.

  For example, a design app might charge merchants once for premium templates, or a marketing app could bill for individual campaign setups without ongoing monthly fees.

  Use the `AppPurchaseOneTimeCreate` mutation to:

  * Charge for premium features or content purchases
  * Bill for professional services or setup fees
  * Generate revenue from one-time digital product sales

  The mutation returns a confirmation URL that merchants must visit to approve the charge. Test and development stores are not charged, allowing safe testing of billing flows.
