  [amount off
  discounts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/discount-types/percentage-fixed-amount)

  that are automatically applied on a cart and at checkout. Amount off discounts
  give customers a

  fixed value or a percentage off the products in an order, but don't apply to
  shipping costs.
