title: PriceList - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  A list that defines pricing for [product
  variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant).
  Price lists override default product prices with either fixed prices or
  percentage-based adjustments.


  Each price list associates with a
  [`Catalog`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/Catalog)
  to determine which customers see the pricing. The catalog's context rules
  control when the price list applies, such as for specific markets, company
  locations, or apps.

## Mutations

* [price​List​Create](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/priceListCreate)

  mutation

  Creates a [`PriceList`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PriceList). Price lists enable contextual pricing by defining fixed prices or percentage-based adjustments.

  The price list requires a unique name, currency for fixed prices, and parent adjustment settings that determine how the system calculates prices relative to base prices. To apply contextual pricing, link the price list to a [`Catalog`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/Catalog). When that catalog's context is matched, customers receive the price list's prices.

  * input

    [Price​List​Create​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/PriceListCreateInput)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The properties of the new price list.

  ***

* [price​List​Fixed​Prices​By​Product​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/priceListFixedPricesByProductUpdate)

  mutation

  Sets or removes fixed prices for all variants of a [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) on a [`PriceList`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PriceList). Simplifies pricing management when all variants of a product should have the same price on a price list, rather than setting individual variant prices.

  When you add a fixed price for a product, all its [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) objects receive the same price on the price list. When you remove a product's fixed prices, all variant prices revert to the price list's adjustment rules.

  * prices​To​Add

    [\[Price​List​Product​Price​Input!\]](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/PriceListProductPriceInput)

    ### Arguments

    A list of `PriceListProductPriceInput` that identifies which products to update the fixed prices for.

  * prices​To​Delete​By​Product​Ids

  mutation

  Updates fixed prices on a [`PriceList`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PriceList). This mutation lets you add new fixed prices for specific [`ProductVariant`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant) objects and remove existing prices in a single operation.

  Use this mutation to modify variant pricing on a price list by providing prices to add and variant IDs to delete.
