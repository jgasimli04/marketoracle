title: FulfillmentService - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships
  orders

  on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and
  ship items

  and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with
  Shopify integrations

  include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new
  `FulfillmentService` on a store,

  Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the
  fulfillment service.

  To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to

  [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service
  app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)

  guide.


  ## Mutations


  You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the

  [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),

  [fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),

  and
  [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)

  mutations.


  ## Hosted endpoints


  Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with
  a set of hosted endpoints that

  Shopify can query on certain conditions.

  These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied
  in the `callbackUrl` parameter

  in the

  [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)

  mutation.


  - Shopify sends POST requests to the
  `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
    to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests.

    For more information, refer to
    [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
  - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers`
  endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders
    if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.

    For more information, refer to
    [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).

    Fulfillment services can also update tracking information using the
    [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate) mutation,
    rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
  - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to
  retrieve
    on hand inventory levels for the fulfillment service location if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.

    For more information, refer to
    [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-10-optional-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify).

  To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the
  `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints

  in your development store.


  ## Resources and webhooks


  There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service
  to work.

  To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the

  [FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),

  [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment)
  and

  [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects
  and related mutations.

  To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,

  besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,

  fulfillment services can subscribe to the

  [fulfillment
  order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)

  and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)

  webhooks.

# Fulfillment​Service

object

Requires Apps will need one of the following: `fulfillments`, `products` or `custom_fulfillment_services` (in case of custom fulfillment service). Fulfillment service apps can also access their own fulfillment service records if they have `assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope. Users with access to the app will have access to their fulfillment services.

  If you are using API version `2023-10` or later, and you need to specify custom attributes for the fulfillment service location (for example, to change its address to a country different from the shop's country), use the [LocationEdit](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/locationEdit) mutation after creating the fulfillment service.
