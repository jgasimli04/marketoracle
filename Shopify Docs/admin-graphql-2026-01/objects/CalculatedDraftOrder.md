## Mutations

* [draft​Order​Calculate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderCalculate)

  mutation

  Calculates the properties of a [`DraftOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder) without creating it. Returns pricing information including [`CalculatedDraftOrderLineItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CalculatedDraftOrderLineItem) totals, shipping charges, applicable discounts, and tax calculations based on the provided [`Customer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer) and [`MailingAddress`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/MailingAddress) information.

  Use this mutation to preview total taxes and prices before creating a draft order. It's particularly useful when working with B2B [`PurchasingEntity`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/unions/PurchasingEntity) or when you need to determine costs without committing to a draft order.
