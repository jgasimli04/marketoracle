description: >-
  The FulfillmentOrder object represents either an item or a group of items in
  an

  [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  that are expected to be fulfilled from the same location.

  There can be more than one fulfillment order for an

  [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  at a given location.


  {{ '/api/reference/fulfillment_order_relationships.png' | image }}


  Fulfillment orders represent the work which is intended to be done in relation
  to an order.

  When fulfillment has started for one or more line items, a

  [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment)

  is created by a merchant or third party to represent the ongoing or completed
  work of fulfillment.

  ## Retrieving fulfillment orders


  ### Fulfillment orders from an order


  All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the

  [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)

  connection.


  [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)

  govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.

  An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which
  belong to an order

  if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment
  orders.


  ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment


  Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been
  assigned to their locations with the

  [assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/objects/queryroot#connection-assignedfulfillmentorders)

  connection.

  Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned
  fulfillment orders

  should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a

  [fulfillment
  request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)

  and it has yet to be responded to.


  The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access
  scope to access

  the assigned fulfillment orders.


  ### All fulfillment orders


  Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the

  [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)

  query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party
  fulfillment orders on the shop,

  which are accessible to the app according to the

  [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.


  ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order


  ### Fulfillment Order Creation


  After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing
  process which determines

  which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.

  Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders
  will be created

  and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create
  fulfillment orders.


  Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different
  lifecycles depending on

  the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.


  ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location


  Fulfillment orders are completed by creating

  [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).

  Fulfillments represents the work done.


  For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a
  fulfilment once the digital asset

  has been provisioned.

  For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this
  once

  the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.


  On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,

  a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking
  and packing the items relating

  to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.


  [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management
  app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).


  ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a
  fulfillment service


  For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a
  fulfillment service,

  a merchant or an Order Management App can

  [send a fulfillment
  request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)

  to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they
  fulfill the associated items.

  A fulfillment service has the option to

  [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)

  or
  [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)

  this fulfillment request.


  Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no
  longer be cancelled by the merchant

  or order management app and instead a

  [cancellation request must be
  submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)

  to the fulfillment service.


  Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,

  then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they
  create fulfillments with the

  [fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)

  mutation.

  They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments
  without it and then

  update the tracking information for fulfillments with the

  [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)

  mutation.

  service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).


  ## API access scopes


  Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:


  * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
    `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
    grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
  * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and
  `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
    access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
    These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
    by fulfillment services.
  * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and
  `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
    access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
    assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.

  ### Fulfillment service app access scopes


  Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
  access scope

  and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`

  or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.

  The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their
  location

  (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on
  the shop).

  The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to
  merchant-managed locations

  or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.


  ### Order management app access scopes


  **Order management apps** will usually request
  `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and

  `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to
  manage all fulfillment orders

  on behalf of a merchant.


  If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment
  service,

  then the app should request all

  access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.


  ## Notifications about fulfillment orders


  Fulfillment services are required to

  [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)

  a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is
  that this callback URL will be notified

  whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.


  Both merchants and apps can

  [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)

  to the

  [fulfillment order
  webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)

  to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.

## Queries

* [assigned​Fulfillment​Orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/assignedFulfillmentOrders)

  query

  The paginated list of fulfillment orders assigned to the shop locations owned by the app.

  Assigned fulfillment orders are fulfillment orders that are set to be fulfilled from locations managed by [fulfillment services](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService) that are registered by the app. One app (api\_client) can host multiple fulfillment services on a shop. Each fulfillment service manages a dedicated location on a shop. Assigned fulfillment orders can have associated [fulfillment requests](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderRequestStatus), or might currently not be requested to be fulfilled.

  The app must have the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) to be able to retrieve the fulfillment orders assigned to its locations.

  All assigned fulfillment orders (except those with the `CLOSED` status) will be returned by default. Perform filtering with the `assignmentStatus` argument to receive only fulfillment orders that have been requested to be fulfilled.

## Mutations

* [fulfillment​Order​Accept​Cancellation​Request](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptCancellationRequest)

  mutation

  Accept a cancellation request sent to a fulfillment service for a fulfillment order.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    An optional reason for accepting the cancellation request.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Order​Accept​Fulfillment​Request](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)

  mutation

  Accepts a fulfillment request that the fulfillment service has received for a [`FulfillmentOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) which signals that the fulfillment service will process and fulfill the order. The fulfillment service can optionally provide a message to the merchant and an estimated shipped date when accepting the request.

  Learn more about [accepting fulfillment requests](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#accept-a-fulfillment-request).

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment order associated with the fulfillment request.

  * message

    [String](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/String)

    An optional reason for accepting the fulfillment request.

    [Date​Time](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/DateTime)

    The estimated date and time when the fulfillment order will be shipped.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Order​Cancel](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderCancel)

  mutation

  Cancels a [`FulfillmentOrder`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) and creates a replacement fulfillment order to represent the work left to be done. The original fulfillment order will be marked as closed.

  This mutation works when the fulfillment order has a `SUBMITTED` or `CANCELLATION_REQUESTED` status. For `SUBMITTED` orders, cancellation happens immediately because the fulfillment service hasn't accepted the request.

  ***

  Note

  Orders that have had cancellation requested but the cancellation has yet to be accepted by the fulfillment service might still have work completed despite cancellation.

  ***

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment order to mark as canceled.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Order​Close](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderClose)

  mutation

  Marks an in-progress fulfillment order as incomplete, indicating the fulfillment service is unable to ship any remaining items, and closes the fulfillment request.

  This mutation can only be called for fulfillment orders that meet the following criteria:

  * Assigned to a fulfillment service location,
  * The fulfillment request has been accepted,
  * The fulfillment order status is `IN_PROGRESS`.

  This mutation can only be called by the fulfillment service app that accepted the fulfillment request. Calling this mutation returns the control of the fulfillment order to the merchant, allowing them to move the fulfillment order line items to another location and fulfill from there, remove and refund the line items, or to request fulfillment from the same fulfillment service again.

  Closing a fulfillment order is explained in [the fulfillment service guide](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/build-for-fulfillment-services#step-7-optional-close-a-fulfillment-order).

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment order to mark as incomplete.

  * message

    [String](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/String)

    An optional reason for marking the fulfillment order as incomplete.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Order​Hold](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderHold)

  mutation

  Applies a fulfillment hold on a fulfillment order.

  As of the [2025-01 API version](https://shopify.dev/changelog/apply-multiple-holds-to-a-single-fulfillment-order), the mutation can be successfully executed on fulfillment orders that are already on hold. To place multiple holds on a fulfillment order, apps need to supply the [handle](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentHold#field-handle) field. Each app can place up to 10 active holds per fulfillment order. If an app attempts to place more than this, the mutation will return [a user error indicating that the limit has been reached](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderHoldUserErrorCode#value-fulfillmentorderholdlimitreached). The app would need to release one of its existing holds before being able to apply a new one.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment order on which a fulfillment hold is applied.

  * fulfillment​Hold

    [Fulfillment​Order​Hold​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/FulfillmentOrderHoldInput)

    required

    The details of the fulfillment hold applied on the fulfillment order.

  ***

* [fulfillment​Order​Move](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderMove)

  mutation

  Changes the location which is assigned to fulfill a number of unfulfilled fulfillment order line items.

  Moving a fulfillment order will fail in the following circumstances:

  * The fulfillment order is closed.
  * The fulfillment order has had progress manually reported. To move a fulfillment order that has had progress manually reported, the fulfillment order must first be marked as open resolving the ongoing progress state.
  * The destination location doesn't stock the requested inventory item.
  * The API client doesn't have the correct permissions.

  Line items which have already been fulfilled can't be re-assigned and will always remain assigned to the original location.

  You can't change the assigned location while a fulfillment order has a [request status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderRequestStatus) of `SUBMITTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `CANCELLATION_REQUESTED`, or `CANCELLATION_REJECTED`. These request statuses mean that a fulfillment order is awaiting action by a fulfillment service and can't be re-assigned without first having the fulfillment service accept a cancellation request. This behavior is intended to prevent items from being fulfilled by multiple locations or fulfillment services.

  ### How re-assigning line items affects fulfillment orders

  **First scenario:** Re-assign all line items belonging to a fulfillment order to a new location.

  In this case, the [assignedLocation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/fulfillmentorder#field-fulfillmentorder-assignedlocation) of the original fulfillment order will be updated to the new location.

  **Second scenario:** Re-assign a subset of the line items belonging to a fulfillment order to a new location. You can specify a subset of line items using the `fulfillmentOrderLineItems` parameter (available as of the `2023-04` API version), or specify that the original fulfillment order contains line items which have already been fulfilled.

  If the new location is already assigned to another active fulfillment order, on the same order, then a new fulfillment order is created. The existing fulfillment order is closed and line items are recreated in a new fulfillment order.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    required

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the fulfillment order to be moved.

    \
    **NOTE:** If not supplied, all holds for the fulfillment order will be released. It is highly recommended that apps supply the ids of the holds that they intend to release. Releasing all holds on a fulfillment order will result in the fulfillment order being released prematurely and items being incorrectly fulfilled.

  * external​Id
