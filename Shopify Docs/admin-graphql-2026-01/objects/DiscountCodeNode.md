## Mutations

* [discount​Code​Activate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/discountCodeActivate)

  mutation

  Activates a previously created code discount, making it available for customers to use during checkout. This mutation transitions inactive discount codes into an active state where they can be applied to orders.

  For example, after creating a "SUMMER20" discount code but leaving it inactive during setup, merchants can activate it when ready to launch their summer promotion campaign.

  Use `DiscountCodeActivate` to:

  * Launch scheduled promotional campaigns
  * Reactivate previously paused discount codes
  * Enable discount codes after configuration changes
  * Control the timing of discount availability

  The mutation returns the updated discount code node with its new active status and handles any validation errors that might prevent activation, such as conflicting discount rules or invalid date ranges.

* [discount​Code​Deactivate](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/discountCodeDeactivate)

  mutation

  Temporarily suspends a code discount without permanently removing it from the store. Deactivation allows merchants to pause promotional campaigns while preserving the discount configuration for potential future use.

  For example, when a flash sale needs to end immediately or a discount code requires temporary suspension due to inventory issues, merchants can deactivate it to stop new redemptions while keeping the discount structure intact.

  Use `DiscountCodeDeactivate` to:

  * Pause active promotional campaigns timely
  * Temporarily suspend problematic discount codes
  * Control discount availability during inventory shortages
  * Maintain discount history while stopping usage

  Deactivated discounts remain in the system and can be reactivated later, unlike deletion which persistently removes the code. Customers attempting to use deactivated codes will receive appropriate error messages.

  * id

    [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

    ### Arguments

    The ID of the code discount to deactivate.
