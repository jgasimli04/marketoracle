# Publication

object

A group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) and [collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection) that are published to an app.

Each publication manages which products and collections display on its associated [`Channel`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel).
