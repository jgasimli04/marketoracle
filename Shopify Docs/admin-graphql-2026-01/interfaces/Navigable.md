  * Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.

* [Product​Variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  OBJECT

  The `ProductVariant` object represents a version of a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption), such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options for size and color, then a small, blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be another.

  Use the `ProductVariant` object to manage the full lifecycle and configuration of a product's variants. Common use cases for using the `ProductVariant` object include:

  * Tracking inventory for each variant
  * Setting unique prices for each variant
  * Assigning barcodes and SKUs to connect variants to fulfillment services
  * Attaching variant-specific images and media
  * Setting delivery and tax requirements
  * Supporting product bundles, subscriptions, and selling plans

  A `ProductVariant` is associated with a parent [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) object. `ProductVariant` serves as the central link between a product's merchandising configuration, inventory, pricing, fulfillment, and sales channels within the GraphQL Admin API schema. Each variant can reference other GraphQL types such as:

  * [`InventoryItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem): Used for inventory tracking
  * [`Image`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Image): Used for variant-specific images
  * [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup): Used for subscriptions and selling plans
