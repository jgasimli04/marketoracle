* [Collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection)

  OBJECT

  The `Collection` object represents a group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that merchants can organize to make their stores easier to browse and help customers find related products. Collections serve as the primary way to categorize and display products across [online stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store), [sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels), and marketing campaigns.

  There are two types of collections:

  * **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**: You specify the products to include in a collection.
  * **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**: You define rules, and products matching those rules are automatically included in the collection.

  The `Collection` object provides information to:

  * Organize products by category, season, or promotion.
  * Automate product grouping using rules (for example, by tag, type, or price).
  * Configure product sorting and display order (for example, alphabetical, best-selling, price, or manual).
  * Manage collection visibility and publication across sales channels.
  * Add rich descriptions, images, and metadata to enhance discovery.

  ***

  Note

  Collections are unpublished by default. To make them available to customers, use the [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish) mutation after creation.

  ***

  Collections can be displayed in a store with Shopify's theme system through [Liquid templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection) and can be customized with [template suffixes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/alternate-templates) for unique layouts. They also support advanced features like translated content, resource feedback, and contextual publication for location-based catalogs.

* [Media​Image](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/MediaImage)

  OBJECT

  The `MediaImage` object represents an image hosted on Shopify's [content delivery network (CDN)](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/best-practices/performance/platform#shopify-cdn). Shopify CDN is a content system that serves as the primary way to store, manage, and deliver visual content for products, variants, and other resources across the Shopify platform.

  The `MediaImage` object provides information to:

  * Store and display product and variant images across online stores, admin interfaces, and mobile apps.
  * Retrieve visual branding elements, including logos, banners, favicons, and background images in checkout flows.
  * Retrieve signed URLs for secure, time-limited access to original image files.

  Each `MediaImage` object provides both the processed image data (with automatic optimization and CDN delivery) and access to the original source file. The image processing is handled asynchronously, so images might not be immediately available after upload. The [`status`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/mediaimage#field-MediaImage.fields.status) field indicates when processing is complete and the image is ready for use.

  The `MediaImage` object implements the [`Media`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/Media) interface alongside other media types, like videos and 3D models.

  Each metaobject includes fields that match the field types and validation rules specified in its definition, which also determines the metaobject's capabilities, such as storefront visibility, publishing and translation support. [`Metafields`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Metafield) can reference metaobjects to connect custom data with [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) objects, [`Collection`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection) objects, and other Shopify resources.

* [Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  OBJECT

  The `Order` object represents a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a store. Use the `Order` object to handle the complete purchase lifecycle from checkout to fulfillment.

  Use the `Order` object when you need to:

  * Display order details on customer account pages or admin dashboards.
  * Create orders for phone sales, wholesale customers, or subscription services.
  * Update order information like shipping addresses, notes, or fulfillment status.
  * Process returns, exchanges, and partial refunds.
  * Generate invoices, receipts, and shipping labels.

  The `Order` object serves as the central hub connecting customer information, product details, payment processing, and fulfillment data within the GraphQL Admin API schema.

  ***

  Note

  Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older records, then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted access, then you can add the `read_all_orders`, `read_orders`, and `write_orders` scopes.

  ***

  ***

  Caution

  Only use orders data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#requesting-specific-permissions) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

* [Product​Variant](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  OBJECT

  The `ProductVariant` object represents a version of a [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that comes in more than one [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption), such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options for size and color, then a small, blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue t-shirt would be another.

  Use the `ProductVariant` object to manage the full lifecycle and configuration of a product's variants. Common use cases for using the `ProductVariant` object include:

  * Tracking inventory for each variant
  * Setting unique prices for each variant
  * Assigning barcodes and SKUs to connect variants to fulfillment services
  * Attaching variant-specific images and media
  * Setting delivery and tax requirements
  * Supporting product bundles, subscriptions, and selling plans

  A `ProductVariant` is associated with a parent [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) object. `ProductVariant` serves as the central link between a product's merchandising configuration, inventory, pricing, fulfillment, and sales channels within the GraphQL Admin API schema. Each variant can reference other GraphQL types such as:

  * [`InventoryItem`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/InventoryItem): Used for inventory tracking
  * [`Image`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Image): Used for variant-specific images
  * [`SellingPlanGroup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SellingPlanGroup): Used for subscriptions and selling plans

          Filter by channel approval process status of the resource on a channel, such as the online store. The value is a composite of the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#field-Channel.fields.app) (`Channel.app.id`) and one of the valid values. For simple visibility checks, use [published\_status](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#argument-query-filter-publishable_status) instead.

        - Valid values:

          * `* {channel_app_id}-approved`
