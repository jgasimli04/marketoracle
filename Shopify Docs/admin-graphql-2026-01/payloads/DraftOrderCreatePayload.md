  mutation

  Creates a [draft order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder) with attributes such as customer information, line items, shipping and billing addresses, and payment terms. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to:

  * Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
  * Send invoices to customers with a secure checkout link.
  * Use custom items to represent additional costs or products not in inventory.
  * Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
  * Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
  * Take pre-orders.

  After creating a draft order, you can:

  * Send an invoice to the customer using the [`draftOrderInvoiceSend`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderInvoiceSend) mutation.
  * Complete the draft order using the [`draftOrderComplete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderComplete) mutation.
  * Update the draft order using the [`draftOrderUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderUpdate) mutation.
  * Duplicate a draft order using the [`draftOrderDuplicate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderDuplicate) mutation.
  * Delete the draft order using the [`draftOrderDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderDelete) mutation.

  Note

  When you create a draft order, you can't [reserve or hold inventory](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/inventory-management-apps#inventory-states) for the items in the order by default. However, you can reserve inventory using the [`reserveInventoryUntil`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/draftOrderCreate#arguments-input.fields.reserveInventoryUntil) input.
