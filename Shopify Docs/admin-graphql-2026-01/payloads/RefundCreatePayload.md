  mutation

  Creates a refund for an order, allowing you to process returns and issue payments back to customers.

  Use the `refundCreate` mutation to programmatically process refunds in scenarios where you need to return money to customers, such as when handling returns, processing chargebacks, or correcting order errors.

  The `refundCreate` mutation supports various refund scenarios:

  * Refunding line items with optional restocking
  * Refunding shipping costs
  * Refunding duties and import taxes
  * Refunding additional fees
  * Processing refunds through different payment methods
  * Issuing store credit refunds (when enabled)

  You can create both full and partial refunds, and optionally allow over-refunding in specific cases.

  After creating a refund, you can track its status and details through the order's [`refunds`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.refunds) field. The refund is associated with the order and can be used for reporting and reconciliation purposes.

  Note

  The refunding behavior of the `refundCreate` mutation is similar to the [`refundReturn`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnRefund) mutation. The key difference is that the `refundCreate` mutation lets you to specify restocking behavior for line items, whereas the `returnRefund` mutation focuses solely on handling the financial refund without any restocking input.
