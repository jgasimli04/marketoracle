## Mutations with this payload

* [company​Location​Update](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/companyLocationUpdate)

  mutation

  Updates a company location's information and B2B checkout settings. Company locations are branches or offices where [`CompanyContact`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CompanyContact) members place orders on behalf of the company. Contacts must be assigned to a location through `roleAssignments` to place orders.

  The mutation modifies details such as the location's name, contact information, preferred locale, and internal notes. You can also configure the B2B checkout experience through [`BuyerExperienceConfiguration`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BuyerExperienceConfiguration) settings that control whether orders require merchant review, [`PaymentTermsTemplate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PaymentTermsTemplate) settings, shipping address editing permissions, and [`DepositConfiguration`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/unions/DepositConfiguration) requirements.
