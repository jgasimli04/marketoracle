## Mutations with this payload

* [order​Create​Mandate​Payment](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreateMandatePayment)

  mutation

  Creates a payment for an [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) using a stored [`PaymentMandate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PaymentMandate). A payment mandate represents the customer's authorization to charge their payment method for deferred payments, such as pre-orders or try-before-you-buy purchases.

  The mutation processes the payment asynchronously and returns a [`Job`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Job) for tracking the payment status. You can specify the payment amount to collect, and use the [`autoCapture`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreateMandatePayment#arguments-autoCapture) argument to either immediately capture the payment or only authorize it for later capture. Each payment request requires a unique [`idempotencyKey`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreateMandatePayment#arguments-idempotencyKey) to prevent duplicate charges. Subsequent calls with the same key return the original payment result rather than creating a new payment.
