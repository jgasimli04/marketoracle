  OBJECT

  A subscription contract that defines recurring purchases for a customer. Each contract specifies what products to deliver, when to bill and ship them, and at what price.

  The contract includes [`SubscriptionBillingPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionBillingPolicy) and [`SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionDeliveryPolicy) that control the frequency of charges and fulfillments. [`SubscriptionLine`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionLine) items define the products, quantities, and pricing for each recurring [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The contract tracks [`SubscriptionBillingAttempt`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/SubscriptionBillingAttempt) records, payment status, and generated orders throughout its lifecycle. [`App`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/App) instances manage contracts through various status transitions including active, paused, failed, cancelled, or expired states.
