## Possible returns

* Bulk​Operation

  [Bulk​Operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation)

  An asynchronous operation that exports large datasets or imports data in bulk. Create bulk operations using [bulkOperationRunQuery](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/bulkOperationRunQuery) to export data or [bulkOperationRunMutation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/bulkOperationRunMutation) to import data.

  After creation, check the [`status`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation#field-BulkOperation.fields.status) field to track progress. When completed, the [`url`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation#field-BulkOperation.fields.url) field contains a link to download results in [JSONL](http://jsonlines.org/) format. The [`objectCount`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation#field-BulkOperation.fields.objectCount) field shows the running total of processed objects, while [`rootObjectCount`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation#field-BulkOperation.fields.rootObjectCount) tracks only root-level objects in nested queries.

  If an operation fails but retrieves partial data, then the [`partialDataUrl`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation#field-BulkOperation.fields.partialDataUrl) field provides access to incomplete results.

  ***

  Note

  `url` and `partialDataUrl` values expire after seven days.
