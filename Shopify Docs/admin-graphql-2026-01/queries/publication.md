  [Publication](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Publication)

  A group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) and [collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection) that are published to an app.

  Publications support scheduled publishing through future publish dates for online store channels, allowing merchants to coordinate product launches and promotional campaigns.

          Filter by products that have a reduced price. For more information, refer to the [`CollectionRule`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CollectionRule) object.

        - Example:

          * `is_price_reduced:true`

          Filters resources by metafield value. Format: `metafields.{namespace}.{key}:{value}`. Learn more about [querying by metafield value](https://shopify.dev/apps/build/custom-data/metafields/query-by-metafield-value).

        - Example:

          * `metafields.custom.on_sale:true`
          * `metafields.product.material:"gid://shopify/Metaobject/43458085"`

          Filter by products that are out of stock in at least one location.

        - Example:

          * `out_of_stock_somewhere:true`

          Filter by the product variant [`price`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Productvariant#field-price) field.

        - Example:

          * `price:100.57`

          * `product_configuration_owner:10001`

          Filter by channel approval process status of the resource on a channel, such as the online store. The value is a composite of the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#field-Channel.fields.app) (`Channel.app.id`) and one of the valid values. For simple visibility checks, use [published\_status](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#argument-query-filter-publishable_status) instead.

        - Valid values:

          * `* {channel_app_id}-approved`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-rejected`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-needs_action`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-awaiting_review`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-published`

          * `* {channel_app_id}-scheduled`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-provisionally_published`

          Example:

          * `product_publication_status:189769876-approved`

          Filter by a comma-separated list of [product types](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/details/product-type).

        - Example:

          * `product_type:snowboard`

          Filter by a comma-separated list of publication IDs that are associated with the product.

        - Example:

          * `publication_ids:184111530305,184111694145`

          **Deprecated:** This parameter is deprecated as of 2025-12 and will be removed in a future API version. Use [published\_status](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#argument-query-filter-publishable_status) for visibility checks. Filter by the publishable status of the resource on a channel. The value is a composite of the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`) and one of the valid status values.

        - Valid values:

          * `* {channel_app_id}-unset`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-pending`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-approved`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-not_approved`

          Example:

          * `publishable_status:580111-unset`
          * `publishable_status:580111-pending`

          Filter by the date and time when the product was published to the online store and other sales channels.

        - Example:

          * `published_at:>2020-10-21T23:39:20Z`
          * `published_at:<now`
          * `published_at:<=2024`

          Filter resources by their visibility and publication state on a channel. Online store channel filtering: - `online_store_channel`: Returns all resources in the online store channel, regardless of publication status. - `published`/`visible`: Returns resources that are published to the online store. - `unpublished`: Returns resources that are not published to the online store. Channel-specific filtering using the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`) with suffixes: - `{channel_app_id}-published`: Returns resources published to the specified channel. - `{channel_app_id}-visible`: Same as `{channel_app_id}-published` (kept for backwards compatibility). - `{channel_app_id}-intended`: Returns resources added to the channel but not yet published. - `{channel_app_id}-hidden`: Returns resources not added to the channel or not published. Other: - `unavailable`: Returns resources not published to any channel.

        - Valid values:

          * `online_store_channel`
          * `published`
          * `visible`
          * `unpublished`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-published`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-visible`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-intended`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-hidden`
          * `unavailable`

          Example:

          * `published_status:online_store_channel`
          * `published_status:published`
          * `published_status:580111-published`
          * `published_status:580111-hidden`
          * `published_status:unavailable`

          Filter by the product variant [`sku`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant#field-sku) field. [Learn more about SKUs](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/details/sku).

        - Example:

          * `sku:XYZ-12345`

          Filter by a comma-separated list of statuses. You can use statuses to manage inventory. Shopify only displays products with an `ACTIVE` status in online stores, sales channels, and apps.

        - Valid values:

          * `active` Default
          * `archived`

        - Example:

          * `tag_not:my_tag`

          Filter by the product [`title`](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product#field-title) field.

        - Example:
