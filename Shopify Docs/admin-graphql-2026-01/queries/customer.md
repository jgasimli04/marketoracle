        - Example:

          * `source_identifier:1234-12-1000`

          Filter by the platform where the order was placed to distinguish between web orders, POS sales, draft orders, or third-party channels. Use this filter to analyze sales performance across different ordering methods.

          Filter by test orders. Test orders are made using the [Shopify Bogus Gateway](https://help.shopify.com/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders/payments-test-mode#bogus-gateway) or a payment provider with test mode enabled.

        - Example:

          * `test:true`

          Filter by the order weight. This filter supports both exact values and ranges, and is to be used to filter orders by the total weight of all items (excluding packaging). It takes a unit of measurement as a suffix. It accepts the following units: g, kg, lb, oz.

        - Example:

          * `total_weight:10.5kg`
          * `total_weight:>=5g total_weight:<=20g`
          * `total_weight:.5 lb`

          Filter by the date and time when the order was last updated in Shopify's system.

          Example:

          * `updated_at:2020-10-21T23:39:20Z`
          * `updated_at:<now`
