title: collectionByHandle - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Retrieves a collection by its unique handle identifier. Handles provide a
  URL-friendly way to reference collections and are commonly used in storefront
  URLs and navigation.


  For example, a collection with the title "Summer Sale" might have the handle
  `summer-sale`, allowing you to fetch it directly without knowing the internal
  ID.


  Use `CollectionByHandle` to:

  - Fetch collections for storefront display and navigation

  - Build collection-based URLs and routing systems

  - Validate collection existence before displaying content


  Handles are automatically generated from collection titles but can be
  customized by merchants for SEO and branding purposes.

## Possible returns

* Collection

  [Collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection)

  The `Collection` object represents a group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that merchants can organize to make their stores easier to browse and help customers find related products. Collections serve as the primary way to categorize and display products across [online stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store), [sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels), and marketing campaigns.

  There are two types of collections:

  * **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**: You specify the products to include in a collection.
  * **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**: You define rules, and products matching those rules are automatically included in the collection.

  The `Collection` object provides information to:

  * Organize products by category, season, or promotion.
  * Automate product grouping using rules (for example, by tag, type, or price).
  * Configure product sorting and display order (for example, alphabetical, best-selling, price, or manual).
  * Manage collection visibility and publication across sales channels.
  * Add rich descriptions, images, and metadata to enhance discovery.

  ***

  Note

  Collections are unpublished by default. To make them available to customers, use the [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish) mutation after creation.

  ***

  Collections can be displayed in a store with Shopify's theme system through [Liquid templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection) and can be customized with [template suffixes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/alternate-templates) for unique layouts. They also support advanced features like translated content, resource feedback, and contextual publication for location-based catalogs.
