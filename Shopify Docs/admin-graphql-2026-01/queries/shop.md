          * `customer_date: >='2024-01-01'`

          * `total_spent:>100.50`
          * `total_spent:>50.00`

The value is a composite of the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#field-Channel.fields.app) (`Channel.app.id`) and one of the valid values. For simple visibility checks, use [published\_status](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#argument-query-filter-publishable_status) instead.

        - Valid values:

          * `* {channel_app_id}-approved`

          **Deprecated:** This parameter is deprecated as of 2025-12 and will be removed in a future API version. Use [published\_status](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/products#argument-query-filter-publishable_status) for visibility checks. Filter by the publishable status of the resource on a channel. The value is a composite of the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`) and one of the valid status values.

        - Valid values:

          * `* {channel_app_id}-unset`

          * `publishable_status:580111-pending`

          Filter resources by their visibility and publication state on a channel. Online store channel filtering: - `online_store_channel`: Returns all resources in the online store channel, regardless of publication status. - `published`/`visible`: Returns resources that are published to the online store. - `unpublished`: Returns resources that are not published to the online store. Channel-specific filtering using the [channel `app` ID](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Channel#app-price) (`Channel.app.id`) with suffixes: - `{channel_app_id}-published`: Returns resources published to the specified channel. - `{channel_app_id}-visible`: Same as `{channel_app_id}-published` (kept for backwards compatibility). - `{channel_app_id}-intended`: Returns resources added to the channel but not yet published. - `{channel_app_id}-hidden`: Returns resources not added to the channel or not published. Other: - `unavailable`: Returns resources not published to any channel.

        - Valid values:

          * `online_store_channel`
          * `published`
          * `visible`
          * `unpublished`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-published`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-visible`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-intended`
          * `* {channel_app_id}-hidden`
          * `unavailable`

          Example:

          * `published_status:online_store_channel`
          * `published_status:published`
