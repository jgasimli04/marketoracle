# metaobject​By​Handle

query

Requires `read_metaobjects` access scope.

Retrieves a [`Metaobject`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Metaobject) by its handle and type. Handles are unique identifiers within a metaobject type.

## Possible returns

* Metaobject

  [Metaobject](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Metaobject)

  An instance of custom structured data defined by a [`MetaobjectDefinition`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/MetaobjectDefinition). [Metaobjects](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data#what-are-metaobjects) store reusable data that extends beyond Shopify's standard resources, such as product highlights, size charts, or custom content sections.

  Each metaobject includes fields that match the field types and validation rules specified in its definition, which also determines the metaobject's capabilities, such as storefront visibility, publishing and translation support. [`Metafields`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Metafield) can reference metaobjects to connect custom data with [`Product`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) objects, [`Collection`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection) objects, and other Shopify resources.
