## Possible returns

* Business​Entity

  [Business​Entity](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BusinessEntity)

  A legal entity through which a merchant operates. Each business entity contains its own [`BusinessEntityAddress`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BusinessEntityAddress), company information, and can be associated with its own [`ShopifyPaymentsAccount`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ShopifyPaymentsAccount). [`Market`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Market) objects can be assigned to a business entity to determine payment processing and [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) attribution.

  Every shop must have one primary business entity. Additional entities enable international operations by establishing legal presence in multiple countries.
