## Possible returns

* Collection

  [Collection](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Collection)

  The `Collection` object represents a group of [products](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product) that merchants can organize to make their stores easier to browse and help customers find related products. Collections serve as the primary way to categorize and display products across [online stores](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/online-store), [sales channels](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels), and marketing campaigns.

  There are two types of collections:

  * **[Custom (manual) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/manual-shopify-collection)**: You specify the products to include in a collection.
  * **[Smart (automated) collections](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/collections/automated-collections)**: You define rules, and products matching those rules are automatically included in the collection.

  The `Collection` object provides information to:

  * Organize products by category, season, or promotion.
  * Automate product grouping using rules (for example, by tag, type, or price).
  * Configure product sorting and display order (for example, alphabetical, best-selling, price, or manual).
  * Manage collection visibility and publication across sales channels.
  * Add rich descriptions, images, and metadata to enhance discovery.

  ***

  Note

  Collections are unpublished by default. To make them available to customers, use the [`publishablePublish`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/publishablePublish) mutation after creation.

  ***

  Collections can be displayed in a store with Shopify's theme system through [Liquid templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/collection) and can be customized with [template suffixes](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/alternate-templates) for unique layouts. They also support advanced features like translated content, resource feedback, and contextual publication for location-based catalogs.

* ### Retrieve a collection's publication status

  #### Description

  Check if a collection is published to a \[sales channel]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/sales-channels). The response includes publication status and publication-related fields.

  #### Query

  ```graphql
  query GetCollectionPublicationStatus($id: ID!) {
    collection(id: $id) {
      id
      title
