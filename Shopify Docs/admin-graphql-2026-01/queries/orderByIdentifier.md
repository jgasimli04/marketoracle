# order​By​Identifier

query

Requires `read_orders` access scope or `read_marketplace_orders` access scope.

Return an order by an identifier.

## Arguments

* identifier

  [Order​Identifier​Input!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/OrderIdentifierInput)

  required

  The identifier of the order.

***

## Possible returns

* Order

  [Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  The `Order` object represents a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a store. Use the `Order` object to handle the complete purchase lifecycle from checkout to fulfillment.

  Use the `Order` object when you need to:

  * Display order details on customer account pages or admin dashboards.
  * Create orders for phone sales, wholesale customers, or subscription services.
  * Update order information like shipping addresses, notes, or fulfillment status.
  * Process returns, exchanges, and partial refunds.
  * Generate invoices, receipts, and shipping labels.

  The `Order` object serves as the central hub connecting customer information, product details, payment processing, and fulfillment data within the GraphQL Admin API schema.

  ***

  Note

  Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older records, then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted access, then you can add the `read_all_orders`, `read_orders`, and `write_orders` scopes.

  ***

  ***

  Caution

  Only use orders data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#requesting-specific-permissions) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.
