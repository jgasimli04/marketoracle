## Possible returns

* Return

  [Return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return)

  The `Return` object represents the intent of a buyer to ship one or more items from an order back to a merchant or a third-party fulfillment location. A return is associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and can include multiple return [line items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/LineItem). Each return has a [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps#return-statuses), which indicates the state of the return.

  Use the `Return` object to capture the financial, logistical, and business intent of a return. For example, you can identify eligible items for a return and issue customers a refund for returned items on behalf of the merchant.

  Learn more about providing a [return management workflow](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/build-return-management) for merchants. You can also manage [exchanges](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-exchanges), [reverse fulfillment orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-fulfillment-orders), and [reverse deliveries](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/returns-apps/manage-reverse-deliveries) on behalf of merchants.

* ### Retrieve a return's reverse fulfillment orders

  #### Description

  Retrieve the reverse fulfillment orders associated with a return. This example shows how to query the \`reverseFulfillmentOrders\` connection to get the IDs of related reverse fulfillment orders, which are used for tracking the logistics of returned items.

* ### Retrieve a return's status and line items

  #### Description

  Retrieve the status and the first ten return line items associated with a return. The example shows how to structure the query to access the return's name, order ID, and the relevant attributes of the return line items, such as quantity, return reason, and total weight. The return status is \`OPEN\`, which indicates tha the query was successfully executed. The example uses the \`... on ReturnLineItem\` \[fragment]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/graphql/basics/advanced#inline-fragments) to access fields that only exist on the \[\`ReturnLineItem\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ReturnLineItem) object.

    return(id: "gid://shopify/Return/945000954") {
