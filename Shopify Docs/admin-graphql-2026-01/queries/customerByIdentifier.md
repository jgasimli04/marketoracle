        - Example:

          * `test:true`

          Filter by the order weight. This filter supports both exact values and ranges, and is to be used to filter orders by the total weight of all items (excluding packaging). It takes a unit of measurement as a suffix. It accepts the following units: g, kg, lb, oz.

        - Example:

          * `total_weight:10.5kg`
          * `total_weight:>=5g total_weight:<=20g`
