* id

  [ID!](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/scalars/ID)

  required

  The ID of the `Order` to return.

***

## Possible returns

* Order

  [Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)

  The `Order` object represents a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a store. Use the `Order` object to handle the complete purchase lifecycle from checkout to fulfillment.

  Use the `Order` object when you need to:

  * Display order details on customer account pages or admin dashboards.
  * Create orders for phone sales, wholesale customers, or subscription services.
  * Update order information like shipping addresses, notes, or fulfillment status.
  * Process returns, exchanges, and partial refunds.
  * Generate invoices, receipts, and shipping labels.

  The `Order` object serves as the central hub connecting customer information, product details, payment processing, and fulfillment data within the GraphQL Admin API schema.

  ***

  Note

  Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older records, then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted access, then you can add the `read_all_orders`, `read_orders`, and `write_orders` scopes.

  ***

  ***

  Caution

  Only use orders data if it's required for your app's functionality. Shopify will restrict [access to scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#requesting-specific-permissions) for apps that don't have a legitimate use for the associated data.

* ### Calculate a proportional duty refund

  #### Description

  This query calculates the duty refund amount for an order using a \`PROPORTIONAL\` \[refund type]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/RefundDutyRefundType). The duty is refunded in proportion to the items being refunded (for example, if refunding one of three items, a third of the duty would be refunded). The example uses the \[\`RefundDutyInput\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input\_objects/RefundDutyInput) and \[\`RefundLineItemInput\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input\_objects/RefundLineItemInput) input objects to determine the amount that should be refunded to customers for the selected items.

  #### Query

  ```graphql
  query suggestedRefund {
    order(id: "gid://shopify/Order/469306983") {
      suggestedRefund(refundLineItems: [{lineItemId: "gid://shopify/LineItem/983004162", quantity: 1}], refundDuties: [{dutyId: "gid://shopify/Duty/1064114503", refundType: PROPORTIONAL}]) {

* ### Calculate a refund to store credit

  #### Description

  This query calculates a suggested refund for a specific \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The example uses the \[\`RefundLineItemInput\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input\_objects/RefundLineItemInput) input object to specify which line items to include in the calculation. The \[\`RefundMethodAllocation\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input\_objects/RefundMethodAllocation) input object is used to specify if the suggested refund should be allocated to store credit or the original payment methods.

* ### Calculate a suggested refund

  #### Description

  This query calculates a suggested refund for a specific \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The example uses the \[\`RefundLineItemInput\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input\_objects/RefundLineItemInput) input object to specify which line items to include in the calculation and returns the subtotal of each refunded item.

  #### Query

  ```graphql
  query SuggestedRefund($id: ID!, $refundLineItems: [RefundLineItemInput!]) {
    order(id: $id) {
      id
      suggestedRefund(refundLineItems: $refundLineItems) {
        subtotalSet {
          shopMoney {

* ### Retrieve a list of fulfillment orders

  #### Description

  This query retrieves a list of fulfillment orders for an \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order), providing information about how the order's line items are grouped for fulfillment. It uses the \`fulfillmentOrders\` field to return \[\`FulfillmentOrder\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder) objects that contain data such as assigned location, delivery method, and associated line items.

* ### Retrieve a list of transactions

  #### Description

  This query retrieves the first 10 transactions for an \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order). The example uses the \`transactions\` field which returns a list of \[\`OrderTransaction\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction) objects with comprehensive data, including payment details, gateway information, and current status. The query also uses inline fragments to retrieve information about payment methods.

  #### Description

  This query retrieves the first 10 \[sales agreements]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/SalesAgreement) for a modified \[order]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order).
