  The paginated list of fulfillment orders assigned to the shop locations owned
  by the app.


  Assigned fulfillment orders are fulfillment orders that are set to be
  fulfilled from locations

  managed by

  [fulfillment
  services](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)

  that are registered by the app.

  One app (api_client) can host multiple fulfillment services on a shop.

  Each fulfillment service manages a dedicated location on a shop.

  Assigned fulfillment orders can have associated

  [fulfillment
  requests](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderRequestStatus),

  or might currently not be requested to be fulfilled.


  The app must have the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders`

  [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes)

  to be able to retrieve the fulfillment orders assigned to its locations.


  All assigned fulfillment orders (except those with the `CLOSED` status) will
  be returned by default.

  Perform filtering with the `assignmentStatus` argument

  to receive only fulfillment orders that have been requested to be fulfilled.
