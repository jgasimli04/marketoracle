  and includes [refund line
  items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/RefundLineItem)

A refund is associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and includes [refund line items](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/RefundLineItem) that specify which items were refunded.

## Possible returns

* Refund

  [Refund](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Refund)

  The `Refund` object represents a financial record of money returned to a customer from an order. It provides a comprehensive view of all refunded amounts, transactions, and restocking instructions associated with returning products or correcting order issues.

  The `Refund` object provides information to:

  * Process customer returns and issue payments back to customers
  * Handle partial or full refunds for line items with optional inventory restocking
  * Refund shipping costs, duties, and additional fees
  * Issue store credit refunds as an alternative to original payment method returns
  * Track and reconcile all financial transactions related to refunds

  Each `Refund` object maintains detailed records of what was refunded, how much was refunded, which payment transactions were involved, and any inventory restocking that occurred. The refund can include multiple components such as product line items, shipping charges, taxes, duties, and additional fees, all calculated with proper currency handling for international orders.

  Refunds are always associated with an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) and can optionally be linked to a [return](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Return) if the refund was initiated through the returns process. The refund tracks both the presentment currency (what the customer sees) and the shop currency for accurate financial reporting.

  ***

  Note

  The existence of a `Refund` object doesn't guarantee that the money has been returned to the customer. The actual financial processing happens through associated [`OrderTransaction`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction) objects, which can be in various states, such as pending, processing, success, or failure. To determine if money has actually been refunded, check the [status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/OrderTransaction#field-OrderTransaction.fields.status) of the associated transactions.
