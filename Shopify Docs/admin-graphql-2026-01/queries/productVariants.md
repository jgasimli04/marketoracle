title: productVariants - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Retrieves a list of [product
  variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  associated with a
  [product](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Product).


  A product variant is a specific version of a product that comes in more than

  one
  [option](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption),

  such as size or color. For example, if a merchant sells t-shirts with options
  for size and color,

  then a small, blue t-shirt would be one product variant and a large, blue
  t-shirt would be another.


  Use the `productVariants` query when you need to:


  - Search for product variants by attributes such as SKU, barcode, or inventory
  quantity.

  - Filter product variants by attributes, such as whether they're gift cards or
  have custom metafields.

  - Fetch product variants for bulk operations, such as updating prices or
  inventory.

  - Preload data for product variants, such as inventory items, selected
  options, or associated products.


  The `productVariants` query supports
  [pagination](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/pagination-graphql)

  to handle large product catalogs and [saved
  searches](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/productVariants#arguments-savedSearchId)

  for frequently used product variant queries.


  The `productVariants` query returns product variants with their associated
  metadata, including:


  - Basic product variant information (for example, title, SKU, barcode, price,
  and inventory)

  - Media attachments (for example, images and videos)

  - Associated products, selling plans, bundles, and metafields

* ### Retrieve product variants by SKU pattern

  #### Description

  Retrieve product variants using a \[SKU]\(https://help.shopify.com/manual/products/details/sku) pattern. This example uses a wildcard search to find all product variants with SKUs that start with "element". The \`\*\` wildcard allows you to find multiple variants that share a common SKU prefix, which is useful for finding related products or product lines.
