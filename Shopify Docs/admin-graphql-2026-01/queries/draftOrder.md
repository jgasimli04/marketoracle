## Possible returns

* Draft​Order

  [Draft​Order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DraftOrder)

  An order that a merchant creates on behalf of a customer. Draft orders are useful for merchants that need to do the following tasks:

  * Create new orders for sales made by phone, in person, by chat, or elsewhere. When a merchant accepts payment for a draft order, an order is created.
  * Send invoices to customers to pay with a secure checkout link.
  * Use custom items to represent additional costs or products that aren't displayed in a shop's inventory.
  * Re-create orders manually from active sales channels.
  * Sell products at discount or wholesale rates.
  * Take pre-orders.

  For draft orders in multiple currencies `presentment_money` is the source of truth for what a customer is going to be charged and `shop_money` is an estimate of what the merchant might receive in their shop currency.
