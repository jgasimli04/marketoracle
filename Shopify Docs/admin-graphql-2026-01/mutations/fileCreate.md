title: fileCreate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates file assets for a store from external URLs or files that were
  previously uploaded using the

  [`stagedUploadsCreate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/stageduploadscreate)

  mutation.


  Use the `fileCreate` mutation to add various types of media and documents to
  your store. These files are added to the

  [**Files** page](https://shopify.com/admin/settings/files) in the Shopify
  admin and can be referenced by other

  resources in your store.


  The `fileCreate` mutation supports multiple file types:


  - **Images**: Product photos, variant images, and general store imagery

  - **Videos**: Shopify-hosted videos for product demonstrations and marketing

  - **External videos**: YouTube and Vimeo videos for enhanced product
  experiences

  - **3D models**: Interactive 3D representations of products

  - **Generic files**: PDFs, documents, and other file types for store resources


  The mutation handles duplicate filenames using configurable resolution modes
  that automatically append UUIDs,

  replace existing files, or raise errors when conflicts occur.


  > Note:

  > Files are processed asynchronously. Check the

  >
  [`fileStatus`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/interfaces/File#fields-fileStatus)

  > field to monitor processing completion. The maximum number of files that can
  be created in a single batch is 250.


  After creating files, you can make subsequent updates using the following
  mutations:


  -
  [`fileUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fileUpdate):

  Update file properties such as alt text or replace file contents while
  preserving the same URL.

  -
  [`fileDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fileDelete):

  Remove files from your store when they are no longer needed.


  To list all files in your store, use the

  [`files`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/files)
  query.

## Examples

* ### Create a file using a staged upload URL

  #### Description

  Create a file asset using a staged upload URL after uploading the file using the \[\`stagedUploadsCreate\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/stagedUploadsCreate) mutation. This two-step process allows you to first upload large files to a temporary staging location, then create the file record. The example demonstrates creating an image file from a staged upload, which is ideal for large files or batch uploads. The response returns the file ID, upload status, alt text, creation timestamp, and image dimensions.

* ### Create mixed media files with custom filenames

  #### Description

  Create different types of media files including images and documents with custom filenames for better organization. This example demonstrates how to handle multiple \[\`contentType\`]\(https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FileContentType) values in a single file creation operation with descriptive naming conventions. The mutation downloads content from external URLs and creates file records simultaneously, each with appropriate metadata and custom filenames that reflect their purpose. The response returns file IDs, upload status, alt text, and creation timestamps, plus type-specific data like image dimensions and document URLs.
