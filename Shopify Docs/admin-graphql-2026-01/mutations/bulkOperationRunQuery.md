title: bulkOperationRunQuery - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates and runs a [bulk
  operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation)
  to fetch data asynchronously. The operation processes your GraphQL query in
  the background and returns results in a [JSONL](http://jsonlines.org/) file
  when complete.


  Apps can run one bulk query operation and one bulk mutation operation at a
  time per shop. The query must include at least one connection field and
  supports up to five connections with a maximum nesting depth of two levels.


  > Note: Results remain available for seven days after completion.


  For more information, see the [bulk operations
  guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries).
