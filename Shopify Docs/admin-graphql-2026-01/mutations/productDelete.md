title: productDelete - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Permanently deletes a product and all its associated data, including variants,
  media, publications, and inventory items.


  Use the `productDelete` mutation to programmatically remove products from your
  store when they need to be

  permanently deleted from your catalog, such as when removing discontinued
  items, cleaning up test data, or

  synchronizing with external inventory management systems.


  The `productDelete` mutation removes the product from all associated
  collections,

  and removes all associated data for the product, including:


  - All product variants and their inventory items

  - Product media (images, videos) that are not referenced by other products

  - [Product
  options](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOption)
  and [option
  values](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductOptionValue)

  - Product publications across all sales channels

  - Product tags and metadata associations


  The `productDelete` mutation also has the following effects on existing orders
  and transactions:


  - **Draft orders**: Existing draft orders that reference this product will
  retain the product information as stored data, but the product reference will
  be removed. Draft orders can still be completed with the stored product
  details.

  - **Completed orders and refunds**: Previously completed orders that included
  this product aren't affected. The product information in completed orders is
  preserved for record-keeping, and existing refunds for this product remain
  valid and processable.


  > Caution:

  > Product deletion is irreversible. After a product is deleted, it can't be
  recovered. Consider archiving

  > or unpublishing products instead if you might need to restore them later.


  If you need to delete a large product, such as one that has many

  [variants](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductVariant)

  that are active at several

  [locations](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Location),

  you might encounter timeout errors. To avoid these timeout errors, you can set
  the

  [`synchronous`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productDelete#arguments-synchronous)

  parameter to `false` to run the deletion asynchronously, which returns a

  [`ProductDeleteOperation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/ProductDeleteOperation)

  that you can monitor for completion status.


  If you need more granular control over product cleanup, consider using these
  alternative mutations:


  -
  [`productUpdate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productUpdate):

  Update the product status to archived or unpublished instead of deleting.

  -
  [`productVariantsBulkDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productVariantsBulkDelete):

  Delete specific variants while keeping the product.

  -
  [`productOptionsDelete`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/productOptionsDelete):

  Delete the choices available for a product, such as size, color, or material.
