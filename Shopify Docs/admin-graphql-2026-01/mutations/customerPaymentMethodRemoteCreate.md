title: customerPaymentMethodRemoteCreate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a customer payment method using identifiers from remote payment
  gateways like Stripe, Authorize.Net, or Braintree. Imports existing payment
  methods from external gateways and associates them with
  [`Customer`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer)
  objects in Shopify.


  The operation processes payment methods asynchronously. The returned
  [`CustomerPaymentMethod`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CustomerPaymentMethod)
  initially has incomplete details while Shopify validates and processes the
  remote gateway information. Use the
  [`customerPaymentMethod`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/customerPaymentMethod)
  query to retrieve the payment method status until all details are available or
  the payment method is revoked.
