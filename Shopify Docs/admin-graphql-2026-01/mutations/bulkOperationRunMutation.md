title: bulkOperationRunMutation - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates and runs a [bulk
  operation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BulkOperation)
  to import data asynchronously. This mutation executes a specified GraphQL
  mutation multiple times using input data from a [JSONL](http://jsonlines.org/)
  file that you've uploaded to Shopify.


  The operation processes each line in your JSONL file as a separate mutation
  execution. The operation delivers results in a JSONL file when it completes.
  You can run one bulk mutation operation at a time per shop, though a
  [`bulkOperationRunQuery`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/bulkoperationrunquery)
  operation can run simultaneously.
