title: orderEditSetQuantity - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Sets the quantity of a line item on an order that's being edited. Use this
  mutation to increase, decrease, or remove items by adjusting their quantities.


  Setting the quantity to zero effectively removes the line item from the order.
  The item still exists as a data structure with zero quantity. When decreasing
  quantities, you can optionally restock the removed items to inventory by
  setting the `restock` parameter to `true`.
