title: orderEditCommit - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Applies staged changes from an order editing session to the original order.
  This finalizes all modifications made during the edit session, including
  changes to line items, quantities, discounts, and shipping lines.


  Order editing follows a three-step workflow: start with
  [`orderEditBegin`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditBegin)
  to create an editing session, apply changes using various orderEdit mutations,
  and then save the changes with the
  [`orderEditCommit`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditCommit)
  mutation. The mutation can optionally notify the customer of changes and add
  staff notes for internal tracking.


  You can only edit unfulfilled line items. If an edit changes the total order
  value, then the customer might need to pay a balance or receive a refund.
