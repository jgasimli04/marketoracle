  Uninstalls an
  [`App`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/App) from a

  removing their
  [`AppInstallation`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AppInstallation)
  from the merchant's store.


  When an app uninstalls, Shopify automatically performs cleanup tasks, such as
  deleting
  [`WebhookSubscription`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/WebhookSubscription)
  objects and [admin
  links](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/admin/admin-links) associated with
  the app.

  configuration or data. Before you uninstall an app, make sure that you no
  longer need to make API calls for the store in which the app has been
  installed.
