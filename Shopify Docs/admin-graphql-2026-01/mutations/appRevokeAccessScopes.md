title: appRevokeAccessScopes - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Revokes previously granted access scopes from an app installation, allowing
  merchants to reduce an app's permissions without completely uninstalling it.
  This provides granular control over what data and functionality apps can
  access.


  For example, if a merchant no longer wants an app to access customer
  information but still wants to use its inventory features, they can revoke the
  customer-related scopes while keeping inventory permissions active.


  Use the `appRevokeAccessScopes` mutation to:

  - Remove specific permissions from installed apps

  - Maintain app functionality while minimizing data exposure


  The mutation returns details about which scopes were successfully revoked and
  any errors that prevented certain permissions from being removed.

  permissions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes#revoke-granted-scopes-dynamically).
