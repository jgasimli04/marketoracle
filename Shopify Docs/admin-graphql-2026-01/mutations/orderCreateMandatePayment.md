title: orderCreateMandatePayment - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a payment for an
  [`Order`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
  using a stored
  [`PaymentMandate`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/PaymentMandate).
  A payment mandate represents the customer's authorization to charge their
  payment method for deferred payments, such as pre-orders or try-before-you-buy
  purchases.


  The mutation processes the payment asynchronously and returns a
  [`Job`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Job) for
  tracking the payment status. You can specify the payment amount to collect,
  and use the
  [`autoCapture`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreateMandatePayment#arguments-autoCapture)
  argument to either immediately capture the payment or only authorize it for
  later capture. Each payment request requires a unique
  [`idempotencyKey`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreateMandatePayment#arguments-idempotencyKey)
  to prevent duplicate charges. Subsequent calls with the same key return the
  original payment result rather than creating a new payment.
