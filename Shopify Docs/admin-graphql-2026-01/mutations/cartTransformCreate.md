title: cartTransformCreate - GraphQL Admin
description: >-
  Creates a cart transform function that lets merchants customize how products
  are bundled and presented during checkout. This gives merchants powerful
  control over their merchandising strategy by allowing apps to modify cart line
  items programmatically, supporting advanced approaches like dynamic bundles or
  personalized product recommendations.


  For example, a bundle app might create a cart transform that automatically
  groups related products (like a camera, lens, and case) into a single bundle
  line item when customers add them to their cart, complete with bundle pricing
  and unified presentation.


  Use `CartTransformCreate` to:

  - Deploy custom bundling logic to merchant stores

  - Enable dynamic product grouping during checkout

  - Implement personalized product recommendations

  - Create conditional offers based on cart contents

  - Support complex pricing strategies for product combinations


  The mutation processes synchronously and returns the created cart transform
  along with any validation errors. Once created, the cart transform function
  becomes active for the shop and will process cart modifications according to
  your defined logic. Cart transforms integrate with [Shopify
  Functions](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/functions) to provide powerful
  customization capabilities while maintaining checkout performance.


  Cart Transform functions can be configured to block checkout on failure or
  allow graceful degradation, giving you control over how errors are handled in
  the customer experience.
