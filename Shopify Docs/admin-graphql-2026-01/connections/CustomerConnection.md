      - Filter by a case-insensitive search of multiple fields in a document.

      - Example:

        * `query=Bob Norman`
        * `query=title:green hoodie`

        Filter by whether a customer has consented to receive marketing material.

      - Example:

        * `accepts_marketing:true`

        Filter by the country associated with the customer's address. Use either the country name or the two-letter country code.

      - Example:

        * `country:Canada`
        * `country:JP`

        Filter by the date and time when the customer record was created. This query parameter filters by the [`createdAt`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer#field-createdAt) field.

      - Example:

        * `customer_date:'2024-03-15T14:30:00Z'`
        * `customer_date: >='2024-01-01'`

        The customer's email address, used to communicate information about orders and for the purposes of email marketing campaigns. You can use a wildcard value to filter the query by customers who have an email address specified. Please note that *email* is a tokenized field: To retrieve exact matches, quote the email address (*phrase query*) as described in [Shopify API search syntax](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/search-syntax).

      - Example:

        * `email:gmail.com`
        * `email:"bo.wang@example.com"`

        * `id:<=1234`

        Filter by the date and time of the customer's most recent abandoned checkout. An abandoned checkout occurs when a customer adds items to their cart, begins the checkout process, but leaves the site without completing their purchase.

      - Example:

        * `last_abandoned_order_date:'2024-04-01T10:00:00Z'`
        * `last_abandoned_order_date: >='2024-01-01'`

        Filter by the customer's last name.

      - Example:

        * `last_name:Reeves`

        Filter by the date and time that the order was placed by the customer. Use this query filter to check if a customer has placed at least one order within a specified date range.

        * `order_date:'2024-02-20T00:00:00Z'`
        * `order_date: >='2024-01-01'`
        * `order_date:'2024-01-01..2024-03-31'`

        Filter by the total number of orders a customer has placed.

      - Example:

        * `orders_count:5`

        The phone number of the customer, used to communicate information about orders and for the purposes of SMS marketing campaigns. You can use a wildcard value to filter the query by customers who have a phone number specified.

      - Example:

        * `phone:+18005550100`
        * `phone:*`

        Filter by the [state](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Customer#field-state) of the customer's account with the shop. This filter is only valid when [Classic Customer Accounts](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/CustomerAccountsV2#field-customerAccountsVersion) is active.

      - Example:

        * `state:ENABLED`
        * `state:INVITED`
        * `state:DISABLED`
        * `state:DECLINED`

        Filter by the tags that are associated with the customer. This query parameter accepts multiple tags separated by commas.

      - Example:

        * `tag:'VIP'`
        * `tag:'Wholesale,Repeat'`

        Filter by the tags that aren't associated with the customer. This query parameter accepts multiple tags separated by commas.

      - Example:

        * `tag_not:'Prospect'`
        * `tag_not:'Test,Internal'`

        Filter by the total amount of money a customer has spent across all orders.

      - Example:

        * `total_spent:100.50`
        * `total_spent:50.00`
        * `total_spent:>100.50`
        * `total_spent:>50.00`

        The date and time, matching a whole day, when the customer's information was last updated.

        Example:

        * `updated_at:2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
        * `updated_at:<now`
        * `updated_at:<=2024`
